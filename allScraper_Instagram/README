The files in this folder are used for scraping images/metadata from instagram for a given list of hashtags.

Scraping Instagram on Oracle cloud:

1. Since Instagram doesn’t have any API, we have to sign in to a fake account and use that for data scraping.
2. Fictitious account created for scraping
3. Selenium was used to scrape all of the 118 unique hashtags.
  For some hashtags (e.g #cbd) there were a lot of posts (>10M) For such hashtags, how many posts do we need to scrape?
  For some hashtags (e.g #blowingclouds) there were a lot of irrelevant posts (e.g posts of actual clouds in the sky)
  For some hashtags (e.g #cannabis) NO post was found. This maybe because instagram has banned such hashtags? (I’m not sure, but no post could be found)
A new list was created called: 'insta_hashtags.csv'

Navigating the repository:

For windows, use: getShortcodes_fromHashtags_win.py (uses selenium in normal mode)
For Linux instance (OCI) use: getShortcodes_fromHashtags_linux.py (uses selenium in headless mode)

Either of these codes scrape the links of the posts that are relevant to the corresponding hashtag
and create csv files under scrapedData/post_links/...

usage of scrapedData/scrapeData_fromShortcodes.py:
Uses the instaloader library : https://instaloader.github.io/module/structures.html
This is the code to strip shortcodes from csv files in scrapedData/post_links/ folder
It creates folders in scrapedData by hashtag name with all the raw metadata
(Run this in the scraped data folder directly, it will automatically create folders)


usage of scrapedData/metadata_generator.py:
>>>python metadata_generator.py <folder name without quotes>
This file generates a csv file of metadata:
('Name','Date', 'Location','#likes','#comments','caption','hashtags','tagged-users')
from the posts collected by 'instaloader' library and placed in a folder
The json files should be extracted and kept in the folder
