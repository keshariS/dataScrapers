This image shows that you don't need best of the best to get you something reasonable. 

I shot this with a 20 dollar objective and a 20 dollar lens I bought a few years back.

The focal length was .390mm from front to back and was 195 shots I believe. 

The lens is 100% manual and I honestly hardly know what all the numbers on it mean 🤣🤘

Have a blessed day all!! 🙏🙏🙏
