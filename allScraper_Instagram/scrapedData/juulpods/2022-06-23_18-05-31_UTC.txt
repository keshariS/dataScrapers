The Food and Drug Administration issued a ban on Juul e-cigarettes today, stating “the company must stop selling and distributing these products. In addition, those currently on the U.S. market must be removed, or risk enforcement action.”

The FDA has been targeting tobacco companies that they deem are making products aimed at teens in an effort to crack down on underage vaping, and the agency has stated “there is insufficient evidence to assess the potential toxicological risks of using the JUUL products.” Juul discontinued their flavored fruit flavored vapes three years ago in response to accusations that their products target minors, but today’s outright ban comes as a major surprise.

What do you think? Overkill, or a necessary measure to protect public health?
