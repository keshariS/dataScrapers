The SMOK Tech  G-Priv is back, and with it a great power for a proper sub-ohm vaping with huge clouds of vapor!

The popular G-Priv series returns in its fourth version and now not only delivers high performance supported by two replaceable batteries, but also a brand new touch screen for a convenient and quick setup. The bottom door provides easy access to space for two 18650 batteries (not included). These provide not only endurance on a single charge, but also the power needed for the included heating heads. The batteries can be charged directly in the device via the fast USB-C port.

You no longer need buttons to select a mode or adjust wattage, with the G-Priv 4 you just need to touch the large color display, which offers an intuitive user interface and you can adjust everything to your needs. You can conveniently set both power mode and temperature mode. My Mode is also available, in which you create your own mode for the ideal vaping experience. You can then easily switch between the modes created in this way at any time. There are also essential safeguards to protect you from short circuits, overdischarging, overcharging, overheating or reverse polarity.
