A two-day Awareness Drive by the students for the students

Electronic cigarette (e-cigarette) and Vape usage has recently risen to the forefront of medical discussions across the country. A significant increase in e-cigarette use by adolescents has been observed over the last decade. Hence to address this issue as well as raise awareness about the negative consequences of indulgence in the same, a two-day awareness drive was organized in the school, wherein on day one students were shown visual aids on harmful impact of e cigarettes followed by a poster making competition on day two.

The winners of the poster making competition were also appreciated by our Principal and Vice Principal maâ€™am.
