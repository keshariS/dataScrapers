New year, healthier you? If you’re still looking for a new year’s resolution you may want to consider cutting back on vaping and use of e-cigs.
.
Although the concentrations of cancer-causing substances in e-cigs are lower than those in cigarette smoke, there is no safe level of exposure to these carcinogens. Therefore users are at risk for oral cancer and other health issues.
.
E-cigs also contain Nicotine, which is a super addictive chemical that can alter the brain chemistry so the brain doesn't function normally without it! #badnewsbears
.
Talk to your healthcare provider about getting an oral cancer screening. Early prevention and increased awareness for oral cancer save lives!
