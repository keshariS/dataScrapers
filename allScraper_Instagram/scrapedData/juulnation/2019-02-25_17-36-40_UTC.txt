“I have two perfectly good hands that can tie shoes, so I thought there really was no need for me to keep these Hyperadapts. I was about to flip them, but then I heard about the JUUL mod and thought that feature alone made them worth the price. Now I just plug my JUUL into my Nikes to charge! Last week, I was hooping and my JUUL was low on battery, so I plugged it in mid-game. I had to adjust my style to just catch and shoot the entire game since I didn’t want to break the pen, but my JUUL was all charged up and ready to destroy my lungs with that sweet Mango vapor as soon as we lost.”
