Love it when I get to golf and smoke while on the job. Had a fun round and fun smoke.
Great golf-gar
"\[The follow is just meant in jest\] Id definitely bring the Opus X just to show Im better than everyone else. Also the two Tatuaje to pretend Im a man of the people, even though I hate people. Id bring the Davidoff to show Im willing to spend a lot of money on being bored af. Id bring the Crowned Head and the Aganorsa cause they look cool and might fool someone into thinking I have an artistic side that I dont actually have. \[End of sarcasm\]"
All for you or are you taking stuff to pass out?
"Anejo, Wunderlust, J London, Cornelius, Tat 10 yr, and Maestro"
There‚Äôs a couple in there I‚Äôve never seen before but everything I recognize is bomb. Got to go with an A√±ejo for the holidays though.
What opus is next to the a√±ejo?
"If you let me grab three, it‚Äôd be the GOF first, the Aganorsa second, and the anejo third"
"The Davidoff Churchill Late Hour is everything I hoped the regular Davidoff Churchill would be. Same great construction and almost as creamy, but much complex flavor."
Let them both be great
You inspired me to bust out my late hour tomorrow. Thanks.   Can't wait.

My father is usually a safe bet for a good cigar definitely worth some cold air.
My Father seem to be on a tear lately. They're all I ever hear about in the two lounges I go to. Picked up a Le Bijou 1922 earlier tonight that i'm looking forward to.
That smoke is worth some chill. Tasty AF.
"I had one today in the springs during light snowfall. 
I find it very therapeutic. Enjoy!"
Id crawl through a blizzard for a **My Father**. Way to tough it out.
"I‚Äôd buy all of them but depending on my mood would mean what I would prefer

Attabey has a cherry note to it‚Äôs flavor. It‚Äôs very unique. A connecticut but rich

Byron a fuller, richer, more rye bread qualities with leather.

Both are very Cubanesque definitely made for a more international palate. Worth trying. There are several sub-lines of Byron."
"https://www.cigarking.com/rare-byron-12-a-os-flight-assorted-sizes-3-pack-free-shipping-on-your-entire-order/

All three are fantastic blends."
I love Byron and Atabey. Definitely worth the price to experience at least once.
I really enjoy them. Pretty spendy though so it‚Äôs not one I smoke all that often
A classic for sure
I always have some of these on hand. Great for the price
I also really like the Reserva....an excellent smoke. Nut can't go wrong with any LAdC!
"Aromas are always my go-to comfort smoke. Glad you enjoyed it too, brother!"
Thanks for the info. Sounds like a well balanced stick.
"Love this entire line, I can‚Äôt recommend them enough to everyone!!"
I have one in mail.  Worth picking up another? Got a punch 5 taster pack.
I've never needed sex that bad.
"After seeing a god damn bug in a fake stick, never again. That night better have been legendary! lol"
The plot to this post is much thicker than the horse pubes found in this cigar. OP I would have pretended to fall on this thing before I‚Äôd ever try to smoke it.
I've got a friend with Swishers and some spare change.  I'll set you up for 20%

I have a perfectly good hand. I don‚Äôt need to smoke fake Cubans for sex.
r/holup
Lol thats sad
Omg this happened to me too. He was bragging how they have been sitting in his humidor all year. Made me smoke it with him. Didn't have the heart to say anything. Worst smoke ever... Exactly how you describe it
"Lol it‚Äôs funny. But I know where you are coming from.
I‚Äôve done dumb stuff for the ladies too."
What are you talkin bout bro
Wait‚Ä¶
For sex? Lol. Side note: that is not good you smoked that thing breathing in second hand whatever that is.
Oof those are the worst kind. I was on a resort next to someone smoking one that looked a lot like that one. Same honeycomb looking band ‚Äúreplica‚Äù. Smelled like hot garbage.
Your wife‚Äôs gonna be pissed when you get sick from that.
Lol
Hints of dirty diaper with smackings of wet garbage.
Probably gave you cancer
I'd rather get drunk on Mad Dog and have sex with a Vitamix than smoke that thing. More power to ya brother.
"Sometimes with some friends, lying is the most compassionate thing you can do. üòÇ"

I got the same one on Amazon. I liked it for the whole 3 weeks I had it before my table blew over during a windy night and shattered it. RIP.
"Definitely a fake, unofficial cohiba ash tray."
It's 100% legit. I bought the same one from a guy on a beach in the **Dominican Republic**. They only sell the real shit at the beach.
"I also bought a box from CI and they arrived yesterday. People have been kind of dissing on them lately, but I'm excited to try one."
Age them.

Lots of **Olmec** and **Plasencia**.
Must be the camera. Blue/purple cherry. Cool.
I just love that band.
The old velvet rope trick creating a barrier for a smoking/non smoking section. Idk why I didn't think of this one.
You could also just get rid of the people who complained. You don't need that kind of negativity in your life.
Did you move Into your neighbourhood convenience store?
Your house has an exit sign?
This is your house? It looks like some kind of retail/commercial space
"With this being marketed as a budget cigar, I didn't have much in the way of expectations. With that said, I did thoroughly enjoy this stick. The cold draw had slight notes of bourbon with just a touch of barnyard. The burn and draw were very consistent and even no complaints in that department. The flavors definitely fell in line with your standard habano flavor profile. Slightly peppery, notes of bourbon. The only downside was that there wasn't much in the way of any transitions. But overall this was an extremely pleasant smoke just to sit back and relax and enjoy a cool Florida evening. And in my humble opinion it beats the pants off of other budget level sticks from the likes of Camacho or Brickhouse. I might go ahead and try to grab some of these if I ever see them on sale just to have a couple around!"
I got a southern draw sampler and this was my least favorite. Maybe i shoulda put more time on em
I‚Äôm going to be honest‚Ä¶ I thought I was having a stroke reading the name of the cigar. But how are the tasting notes?
"I love everything about this cigar, including the story behind its inception. All the filler tobacco comes from the same farm‚Ä¶a ‚Äúviejo granja‚Äù cigar. This blend checks every box for me."
That‚Äôs a lot of Saka Swag.
What's up with the gorilla. I really like it.
Drop the humidity down to 63-65% . All my sticks burn so much better in that range. If you want to keep your humidor in the high 60 low 70 range drybox whatever your going to smoke.
"As the other person said lower humidity. Especially from 71, once you're over 70 you're getting into mold danger. 

Personally I stay about 65%, mine are nicely non Cuban. People who smoke Cubans recommend 62% for those, I've got a few and have them at 65 with my non and that seems to work pretty good overall."
Is your hygrometer calibrated? Anything over 70% is the danger zone.
That sounds a bit high. First off don‚Äôt trust your hygrometer if you haven‚Äôt calibrated it recently.  Your cigar is telling you the real story.
"How often you puff, and outside humidity also play a role in this."
"Virginia here, I smoke outdoors 90% of the time, until a new cigar lounge opened up the street. On rainy days I often have issues, and my boxes are running around 68."
"You got me there, I don‚Äôt know why we don‚Äôt see more teenagers smoking $10 to $20 cigars?"
"Most cigars are sold by reputable retailers who care about the industry and take the time to ID.

This is one of the cornerstone arguments the PCA makes in their lawsuit agains the FDA. 

It‚Äôs also one reason why some people are against some brands expanding into convenience stores and gas stations.

Less then 1% of youth smoke premium cigars."
I don‚Äôt think underage kids are looking for something that takes an hour to enjoy. And they are probably smoking the other things to impress their friends. I don‚Äôt think younger people find cigars as cool or fashionable. Probably the same reason why kids get drunk on vodka and not scotch.
Im 24 and never smoke a cigar infront of anyone for fear of being labelled pretentious
Its not convenient to smoke and the flavor for new smokers can be off-putting
"Frankly, I just don't think they find it very convenient.

They want something they can sneak around.  Something that either tastes good or gets them baked.  That isn't to say cigars don't taste good of course, but you can see how popular certain flavors on with vapes.  They are practically candy.

Cigars *should* be stored very specifically.

They often cost a lot.

They produce a lot of smoke and are not inconspicuous at all.

I think it's just easier to drop a vape pen or joint in your pocket (or even a weed vaporizer).  Way easier to use around smoke alarms...."
Cost.
Maybe lack of patience required to smoke a cigar??
There is a lot of reasons why younger people don‚Äôt smoke cigars. In nyc some bodegas have a selection of cigars but tbh they are not properly stored and over priced. For 10-20 bucks a kid can buy a vape or bud then spend 10-20 on a cigar that they will smoke for 5 mins. Some people will smoke them at graduations but other then that it‚Äôs rare to see a kid smoking a cigar unless it‚Äôs a backwood with bud.
"Well. I started with colts mild. A filtered ,tipped cigarillo .  Quite a buzz for a 15 year old.  Now 30 years later I‚Äôm finally able to afford the good stuff. (Maybe just better stuff)"
"Cigarettes are intentionally designed to be addictive. Vape pretty much is also it's a higher nicotine load you're getting than from cigars. 

I've got a stoner ex friend who will argue weed isn't addictive but he also hasn't gone more than a few hours without weed in about 20 years so maybe not the best person to vote on that. 

Basically, cigars don't give the same effect as cigarettes or THC. You get some nicotine buzz but nothing like a cigarette or weed's impact."
"I think cigar smoking in many cases is more than just the smoking. It's about the conversation, the ritual, the appreciation. When I first smoked a cigar, I didn't understand. I probably smoked 3-5 cigars from age 18-29 never understood why people smoked cigars. Then I finally had a cigar with my father and brother in law and we sat and talked for 1 1/2 hours and I finally understood. Since then I've been smoking at least 1-2 a week (usually more) and I've met many great people and have had even better conversations."
"I can't speak for everyone but I got started in highschool, cigars were hard to come by but if you knew someone old enough that would buy you smokes you could get them.
 My cousin got me started with cigars and used to buy them for me until he graduated, then from that year on I'd go to a few specific stores that would sell to me and I'd buy a few cigars with my cigs for the week. I don't think most people liked them because of how long they take to smoke and the amount of nicotine, id say most of my classmates back then only smoked a few cigarettes a day so a whole cigar would be a bit much."
"Time, they smoke the other things quickly and don‚Äôt get caught kinda tough to do that with a cigar, they‚Äôre generally large and take more time to smoke. Vapes in particular pull out of pocket hit put back in pocket."
"I guess it‚Äôs a rare experience, but growing up in south Florida we smoked cigars all through high school. It wasn‚Äôt a daily or even weekly thing necessarily - we‚Äôd have a nice long smoke when parents were away or bring them to parties. My friends older brother had a humidor and would hook us up. Good times."
Cigars are for old guys. I didnt start seriously smoking until I was 52.
I think for the most part cigars are influenced. ‚ÄúOh my dad / grandpa used to smoke‚Äù that‚Äôs how 99% of people are introduced imo
"Because no one but Clint Eastwood, Ed Harris, and anyone playing Hannibal Smith looks cool smoking a cigar no matter what they think of their selfie."
"Here‚Äôs the comment to accompany. 

The Julius Caesar is one of my top 5 cigars. I always loved Brickhouse and when I recently discovered these I was intrigued. I didn‚Äôt know JC Newman had higher end cigars so I had to try them. They always deliver and are worth the price. 

The pairing, the peat accompanies the cigar well. Especially Port Charlotte which too me is more bonfire and earthy than any other Islay I have had to date. I think bourbon might be too sweet and take over this smoke. While this Scotch marries well to it and complements the cigar. Particularly in the first third where the smoke is a bit earthy."
I love the Port Charlotte. Smokey and peaty without getting wierd.
That‚Äôs a super scotch.
"I was honestly contemplating whether I should even leave a review for this stick, but I am trying to make it a habit to leave a review for every new CC and NW cigar I try.
 
This is my first Gurkha stick.
 
I am very aware that several people said that the Cellar Reserve line is not a bad line, so I decided to try the 12 years.
 
I am also aware that Gurkha gets a bad rep so I was very curious to know just how bad. Its like wanting to watch a movie that everyone said is bad.
 
My expectations were extremely low. So low that I took 2 back up cigars (Montecristo no. 4 and Joya De Nicaragua Antano Gran Reserva) with me to the lounge just incase this is a horrible smoke.
 
The first third started pretty decent with nice subtle sweet and earthy notes, no complaints what so ever.
 
As I started approaching the second third I got a little bit of bitterness that went away quickly and the subtle sweet and earthy notes continued , but it started burning unevenly so I kept my jet flame close by for minor corrections. But by that time I had already made up my mind that I will not be buying this stick again. I do plan on trying the 15, 18, 21 years, ghost gold and Real, but not anytime soon. I will probably try them once I have tried everything else at my cigar shop, or maybe one Gurkha every couple of months. Won‚Äôt be surprised if it takes me all 2023 to try the remaining 5 mentioned above.
 
As I started with the final third the burn got worse and needed correction every 10 minutes or so. By then I had pretty much gotten use to the mild sweetness earthy notes and corrections. I did get some tunneling after removing the wrapper which was easily fixed with the jet flame. I did feel the need to drink sweetened Moroccan tea with it towards the end, so the sweetness helped. Surprisingly the last inch or so which I smoked with a nubber wasn‚Äôt bad at all. I think the sugar in the tea helped a little.
 
The aroma over all was not bad at all. I was expecting a horrible aroma from the first third or even being told off by the manager at the lounge for smoking such a bad cigar.
 
In conclusion: this stick was not a bad smoke. I was preparing myself for the worst, but thankfully I was not that disappointed. Also the fact that I was with my friend and we had on going conversation the whole time helped for me not to be focused 100% on the cigar.
 
Not a memorable smoke what so ever. If I ever get a box of 20 as a gift, I think it would take me at least 3-4 years to finish them.
 
Score: 2/5

Draw: nothing to complain about
 
Smoke time: 90 to 120 minutes."
"Prior to reading the whole review, I had the 21 year and I would agree a 2/5 is a reasonable score based on my experience. It burned well and had a good draw, but was lacking in flavor and complexity. 
Now on to reading the review!"
Now that's fancy!
Seems like a cheeky gimmick. Will avoid.
Mb3 imo
Mb3 then either gatekeeper or Camacho
Of that bunch MB3
I have a special place in my heart for the aging room!
"If you're looking for full flavor and a touch of sweetness, I second the Camacho triple Maduro!"
Camacho Triple Maduro. The others are‚Ä¶ there.
"Never had most of these ('new tries' list additions right away!), but I love both the AR Nicaraguan, and the AB Prensado (in either order)."
Gatekeeper
UpMan #2 Cigar of the year üòÑ
"If you want strength - Camacho.

Else MB3"
Easily Camacho.
"Another vote for the Triple Maduro.  And a lot of folks like to poo poo the Prensado lately, but it's still one helluva smoke imo."
New World
"The enclave broadleaf is the best on this list. 

Next which new world because the puro especial is fantastic"
Only part that isn't sun-bleached
Thats scar tissue. Your cigar was circumcised.
Where's the band?
Tan lines
"Do you keep the wrapper on the Cigars as you store them. I have never seen this before, some Cigars I have are 5 yrs plus. Only thing comes to mind is the type of glue or adhesive they my use for the band."
Either the Sakakhan or the Foundation Olmec Maduro for me.  hard choice.
Something by **Olmec** or **Plasencia**.
"Top 3 is much easier 
I‚Äôm limiting this to releases from this year.

Caldwell Anastasia

Oliva/Aladino Cuba Aliados 

My Father Le Bijou 100 A√±os 

If you held a gun to my head I guess I would choose the Anastasia.

If we are talking the best cigars that I‚Äôve smoked this year no matter release date:

Davidoff 50 Year Diadema 

CLE 25th 11/18

Rocky Patel Sixty Toro"
"Top 5
1. Mi Querida Blue Toro
2. Man O War Puro Authentico
3. Padron 40 Year Maduro Torpedo
4. Southern Draw Evening Primrose (Will release early 2023)
5. Davidoff Late Hour Toro

Love the dark chocolates and espresso, the spice, and the funky Maduro taste."
The Olmec by Foundation came out this year and I thought it was fantastic. If a COTY just goes to the best cigar I smoked all year I had a Partagas (don't recall the exact vitola) but it was absolutely amazing
"Out of my ratings this year and it‚Äôs tough to choose between these 3 
1) God of Fire Serie B 2019 Toro
2) EP Carrillo Encore Robusto
3) Don Carlos Carlos Fuente Personal Reserve"
Don Carlos no 4
Off the top of my head Muesta de Saka Bewitched.
"Companion de Warped

BWS Intergalactic (construction issues not withstanding)

BLTC Santa Muerte Barrio Santos

Warped La Colmena Amado no. 44

AF Opus X 8-8-8"
"Apostate Cigar‚Äôs The Initiation. It could be that it is local for me or that they are new to me. It stood out to me and of all the cigars I smoked this year, it‚Äôs the most memorable."
Roma craft Neanderthal SGP
Highclere castle Senejter
"Caldwell Anastasia Opera, Aganorsa Supreme Leaf Robusto, and Liga Privada UF-13 Dark."
Gonna have to go with the stillwell star holiday blend 2022.
"Swisher Sweets! Kidding! Sorry, couldn‚Äôt resist. I‚Äôve been digging on the La Gloria Serie R Maduro."
EP Carillo Encore or Aging Room Quattro Vibratto
Anything atabey
"Its been a toss up this year, but both from the same blender. Either Rojas Unfinished Business or Street Tacos Carnitas. The re-release of the Wiseman Firecracker ranks up there as well, but being that it was a limited run, I don't think I would consider it for COTY."
"Dunbarton Sakakahn
Alfsono from Selected Tobacco"
"I've only just started smoking again around August, so I've got very limited experience, but these guys have stuck out to me, in no particular order:

-	AF Casa Cuba Doble Tres
-	AJ Fernandez Bellas Artes Maduro Toro
-	Joya Cabinetta Series No. 11
-	Plasencia Alma del Fuego Robusto
-	AF Hemingway Short Story
-	Padron Series 4000

edit: fixed formatting and added one I somehow forgot"
The Plasencia Alma Fuerte Eduardo I is something special
Foundation cigars Menelik Toro.
I‚Äôm convinced Cigar Aficionado‚Äôs ratings are bought and paid for.
Ramon Allones King of North
Padron 40 year Maduro!
Foundation Olmec Claro
"Obviously biased here but I‚Äôd say my top 3 this year 

Olmec Claro 
Menelik Toro
Don Carlos 3"
Sakakhan or Olmec
"1. Olmec Maduro Robusto
2. Opus X Petite Corona

Bear with me here‚Ä¶.

3. Illusione Rothschild Connecticut (easily accessible, great price for a daily smoke, punches well above it‚Äôs price point)"
"My favorite this year was the La Mission Du L'atelier 2009. Goddamn that's a good cigar.

Runner up is the Viaje Pi√±a.

Third place is the Dunstable Prominentes."
Man my cigar of the year is a tie between two sticks I tried for the first time this year. The Illusione Epernay and the Plansencia 146.
"Tatuaje Avion Tuxtla 13

The Olmec, Sakakhan, and Bijou 100 are on my list to try immediately but I just haven't grabbed em yet."
"They‚Äôre insanely expensive, but the new Alfonso Anejo short robusto was the best cigar I had all year, followed closely by the La Galera  85th Anniversary Connecticut and the Timeless TAA."
"Casa Turant 1880 Maduro Lancero. Incredibly consistent, always, always a terrific smoke. My ideal cigar."
Not a proper judge by any means. But Plasencia Alma Fuerte in all vitolas. It's in my top two favorites the the Liga Privada T52 and new to me this year.
"Stolen thrones - crook of the crown 

Foundation - Olmec Maduro 

Crowned heads - le patisserie"
Unfortunately I haven‚Äôt sampled enough cigars to be an expert‚Ä¶.my favorite new cigar was CUBA ALIADOS BY E.P. CARRILLO.  It was like Pledge & Olivia Melanio had a baby.  Very tasty!
"Undercrown 10 all decked out.   Smoked one, bought a box.  Runner up ... Nub Cameroon"
Makes sense. We can‚Äôt seem to get rid of the Baka at my lounge. They‚Äôll sell eventually but our RoMa guys definitely didn‚Äôt go crazy over them.
I've been on an AJ kick.  I'd say my two favorites this year have been the Ramon Allones and Bellas Artes Maduro.
If we are including everything involved in a cigar smoking session like surroundings and company....I'd say a Perdomo Lounge Edition paired with a port in the Hill Country of Texas.
Partagas white label. Magnificent
Idk but I was very disappointed in the Menelik ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
DTT Bewitched and Foundation Olmec
My fav so far is the Norte√±o by drew estate
Foundation cigars olmec
COTY?
"I quit chasing new brands/blends because I'd rather save that time and effort for craft beer, and honestly I didn't chase a lot of that this year...but from what I smoked from my stash:

Illusione Rothchildes (petite)

601 Blues (box pressed robusto)

Surrogates Cracker Crumbs (short filler, all killer)

&#x200B;

Then again, those are three of my all time favorites..."
Magic Toast for the flavor. Just wish the build quality was better.
Olmec maduro & RP Sixty
La Flor Dominicana L-500. Had it when I evacuated for  Hurricane Ian and haven‚Äôt been able to find it since.
so many great new to me cigars this year.  i smoked a bunch of dunbarton and foundation cigars that i liked.

"Are they real? Step one to answering that would be to ask your friend to trace their source, where or who gave them to your friend and go from there.

The loose bands are probably from drying out, put them in a humidor and forget about them for a few months at least.

It's hard to tell from the pic, but they all look like they are different lengths, if so then maybe they are fake? I would expect real Cubans to be the same size, in length and thickness. Maybe someone else who has a box of these can confirm."
"They look ok to my unprofessional eye. You def need to get them into a humidor asap. They could taste harsh if they're still young, but I'd imagine if they smelled like urine or ammonia is where I'd be concerned. Someone more educated than me would be able to tell you better."
"I found this box at a friends house, he received them as a gift 3 months ago.He didn't know anything about cigars or how to store them. I threw a few away because they were falling apart but those in the pictures look ok to me.
First of all, I am not sure if they are real or fake, the band is very loose, going up and down, I never saw this in other cigars.I smoked one and the taste was not very pleasant, felt very harsh.Any thoughts?"
What is the serial number on the authenticity label?
"I'm still working on it, but I think I got a head start due to being into coffee for a while. It takes a bit to pick up on those little notes and nuances. What I've been doing is jotting things down that I taste as I'm smoking, then I like to go and look up reviews and see if others picked up similar things (understanding that it's wildly subjective, and what I taste could be the complete opposite of what some other person tastes).

My problem is reading through tasting notes and seeing stuff like ""light barnyard..."" what does that taste like, and how do people know?"
"Happened to me recently as well, it feels good when it finally clicks. 

I picked up some cherry notes in an Undercrown Maduro and was pleasantly surprised"
Nice! Do you keep a journal of your experiences?
Awesome! I used an excel spreadsheet to help me keep track of what I've smoked and what I liked about it to start. Really helped me pull out nuances and find out my preference.
"I bought a box of Churchill‚Äôs about 6 years ago. I smoked one immediately and it was like a stick of dynamite (not good). It‚Äôs been sitting at the bottom of my throw away bin along with a handful of Rocky Patels I wasted money on early in my journey. Now that you bring this up, I‚Äôll have to light one up soon and see what 6 years has done. My expectations aren‚Äôt high."
"Out of a 10 pack i got on cbid when I was a noob (thought i was getting such a deal on these normally very expensive cigars) when 8 of 10 were either unsmokable, plugged, or tasted like potting soil I realized they are just a shit cigar"
"When I first started out in this cigar game, went to my local B&M and said I‚Äôm new, what do I smoke? 

Guy picked out 5 cigars for me. MC white series was one if them. I found out very quickly that I am not a mild cigar lover. I‚Äôm sure MC is a great overall brand, but I‚Äôll never buy any white series again. There is just no flavor in my opinion. At least not the flavor I‚Äôm looking for."
Nothing special about these other than for noobs to have something that won't hurt them.  Most quickly move on from these
I bought a five pack on cbid and put them in  the humidor for a month to smoke on thanksgiving. I would compare them to a peppery dry Turkey without gravy.
I‚Äôve only had them a few times but they‚Äôre good for when i want a smooth stick just cuz. Nothing special but good for a stick to mellow out with.
Theyre too light for me.
"I useto daily smoke these, I rested them for about 2 months and got that creamy ALMOST CC taste and aroma. I still enjoy these, but have opted for CC #3/5 for creamy goodness and Pardon or AF if I want some complexity. Imo rest/ age for a few months and see if the blandness can improve. 

If not I suggest Monty #5 or petite tubo for a strong graham cracker/cream. It's the only CC that seems affordable these days, and the only CC I don age."
I give these out to friends or family who don't usually smoke and have little to no nic tolerance. They are inoffensive and construction is decent. Best things I can say...
"I thought it was fine, nothing to write home about and if it was a $7 stick I'd grab one for a yard gar or a lake gar. I doubt I'd grab one again unless I wanted something I've had before and that was the only thing. If it was more than $12 I'd probably pass though."
Was gifted one recently. Seemed fine just got bored. It tastes like smooth nothing.
"Everyone is, they are a subpar cigar that can be had for just a couple dollars per stick. Some say its better than nothing but I'm not sure I agree. Avoid all heritage brands that are produced outside of Cuba as a general rule."
I‚Äôll say avoid inhaling. This is not fun.
"- Don‚Äôt inhale. 
- Don‚Äôt draw too hard (you should be able to put your finger on the outside of the cigar about a quarter inch from the cherry, and it not be hot). 
- Don‚Äôt burn a hole in your clothes, the chair or anything else of value. 
- When you are done just set the cigar down in the ashtray, don‚Äôt put it out, let it die on its own (helps it not smell as bad)."
Let the cigar go out on its own. No need to mash it in the ashtray.
Just because a cigar is expensive doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs the best.
"Wear pants.  And every third puff, get up to walk in a small circle.  Oh, and smoke rings‚Ä¶."
"One thing that took me too long to realize. It is perfectly fine to not finish cigar. These are made for enjoyment. If you feel like cigar tastes really bad or you start to feel really ill, just stop. Even if there is a lot left."
"Same as life...

* Have fun.
* Enjoy Yourself.
* Dont be a dick."
From Twain: don‚Äôt smoke more than one cigar at a time and don‚Äôt smoke when you‚Äôre sleeping.
Rule 1) Enjoy yourself. Rule 2) Don't be rude... thats about it
"https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZTRV4B1dT/

Light your cigar this way. Changed the game for me.

Don‚Äôt cut too much when cutting. Always cut less of the cap than you think you need

The only bad cigars are the ones you don‚Äôt like. If you enjoy it, buy it! 

The only bad cigar pairings are the ones you don‚Äôt like. If you really enjoy cigars and choccy milk, be my guest. 

Don‚Äôt smoke too fast."
"If you're planning on going to a lounge and smoking, be a nice person and buy a stick. You don't have to smoke it there, you can smoke something you brought as long as you pay your dues, lounges aren't cheap to run. This is baseline cigar lounge etiquette."
"No rules. But that isn‚Äôt in the spirit of the question.  

1.  There are a lot of opinions about cigars and cigar makers.  Make your own mind up. 

2.  Gurkha sucks.

3.  Be cool and enjoy it.  That‚Äôs all it‚Äôs for.

4.  Plume isn‚Äôt real it‚Äôs always mold. 

5.  Represent us well.  Smoking is frowned upon in a lot of places.  When you‚Äôre in the right politely explain it and if they don‚Äôt like it fuck em.

6.  There are cheap cigars and expensive cigars that are totally comparable so money snobs about cigars are wrong.  Ignore them. 

7.  Opinions are like assholes.  If they are pushed too much they don‚Äôt mean anything and they stink.

8.  Cigars are like asshole.  If you treat them right you‚Äôll have a nice time. 

9.  Have a nice time.

10.  We are all gonna be alright."
The first rule of cigar club is YOU DONT TALK ABOUT CIGAR CLUB!
Don't put the lit end in your mouth.
"Have fun, don‚Äôt smoke Gurkha, don‚Äôt inhale, learn to retrohale, have some more fun. Oh yeah, don‚Äôt buy Gurkha‚Ä¶"
1) we don't talk about cigar club
"Don't forget to remove the cedar from cigars so equipped. Unless you're the class clown of your local lounge, that is."
"Never inhale.  

Advanced tip: learn how to retrohale and you will experience much more flavor."
"Don‚Äôt be afraid to try different things and if you have questions at you local shop, don‚Äôt be embarrassed and just ask"
Only V cut with your left hand and straight cut with your right. It'll make a noticeable difference. Other people will know as well. Plus only triple puff on Tuesdays.
"Some top comments are great suggestion. There aren't many rules. Smoke what you like, don't listen to the hype or the hate. If you fall in love with a brand and people say it isn't good, understand that your palate, preferences, and budget are your own and different from everyone else.

You don't have to spend a lot of money on anything to enjoy cigars. There are budget cigars, budget lighters, and budget cutters. A gas station Bic lighter is perfectly fine. It's butane and a soft flame which some people prefer over a torch. But don't use a Zippo with liquid fuel, that will mess with the taste of your cigars. However, Zippo makes butane inserts and you can get a Zippos that comes with that already. 

On the money topic. Expensive lighters quit working just like cheap ones. If you want a fancier lighter I'd try to get one free or cheap when either your local shop or an online site is giving them with a box purchase. But make sure it's a box you love, don't just buy something because it's a good deal and comes with swag. Cutters get dull too. I've had my $10 for a year, hundreds of cuts. It's probably time to think about a new one. But I don't plan on spending $30 to $100 on a new one. I do have another pretty good one that came as a freebie from an online order. If I'm going to buy another one it will probably be about $10.

Cheap ""wooden"" Amazon humidors are crap. They may present well, but they don't hold humidity well. In order to get a nice wooden humidor you have to spend hundreds and up. The good news is the best humidor is a sealed food storage container from Sistema, Rubbermaid, Iris, or other companies. Something a little better than the standard Ziplock/Glad containers. It will usually latch down and have like a rubber seal. Use that and some Bovedas and you're good to go. I've got two Sistemas in addtion to others. They hold humidity really, really well. I'm in the south so dry climate isn't a factor for me. But Bovedas have lasted six months and counting in them. 

Try singles. If you have a good local shop go in every so often and talk with them. Tell them you are new to cigars. Ask for recommendations. Buy a couple, smoke them, come back and tell them if you loved them or hated them. At that point you don't have to worry about a humidor. If they put them in a sealed bag for you they are good for a few days. If you want to keep them longer consider getting something a little more solid. Boveda also makes humidor bags that are supposed to last six months or something. And your local shop may have a little two way humidity pack(like a Boveda, but there are other brands) that you can put in that or a freezer ziploc and be good short term.

Just try new stuff. Stay in your budget. Doesn't matter if it's $2 per cigar or $30. Don't feel like you need to spend more to get an enjoyable smoke. 

Once you've gotten a feel for what you like you can stretch your budget a little by doing some online shopping. A really good one to start with is Cigar Page. And a good thing to get from them or your local shop are samplers so you can try different things.

I recommend watching Cigars Daily on YouTube or their website Cigars Daily Plus. Entertaining and informative. Here's a few to start with.

"Respect everyone and their palates. The stick I enjoy may not be for you, and vice versa."
Learn to retrohale (exhale smoke out of your nose) gradually....a very tiny bit at a time.
Do whatever you please.....just don't be a dick about it.
Try not to get caught doing what Bill Clinton did with his cigars
"Eat something, especially when trying something new."
When smoking and puffing take lil breaks put it down. The ember gets really hot youll feel the heat in the smoke. If its too hot it messes with the flavor. Letting the ash get long helps keep it cool. But you might want to keep ashing to avoid accidently ashing on the floor.
"I say, smoke what you like and like what you smoke!"
"* Don't inhale
* Light carefully and gently
* Puff about once per minute
* Don't think you have to find your one cigar that is your jam.  Enjoy lots of different ones because you don't know until you try them.
* Storage issues can be easily overcome if you pay attention to people here
* Have fun with it"
"If you use the communal cutter, don‚Äôt lick the cigar first."
"1. Just like Clinton, dont inhale.
2. Never buy a **Gurkha**.

Thats pretty much it."
"First rule of cigar smoking is to not talk about cigar smoking. 

Also don‚Äôt inhale. That‚Äôs no fun for anyone."
"Try different brands with different wrappers, binders and different sizes until you find what you like. You'll find that you wont enjoy and actually hate some cigars but when you find the ones that you do enjoy...its heaven.

"Nobody really cares about how long your ash can get on the cigar. If it bothers you that it‚Äôs too long, tap it. If you wanna make it look like a granny ash pulling the slots at the casino go ahead. I‚Äôve found that tapping the ash off every 1/3 works well."
Use matches only. Sulfur free. Let the match head burn off before you light up. Toast smoothly. Same procedure as with a jetflame. Keep some distance. No direct burning. Use 2 matches or even more. Take your time. Enjoy the rewards.
Well if you are at the lounge don‚Äôt wet the tip before cutting it with a provided cutter - if you have your own it‚Äôs fine
This guy... We all know that you are actually Ron Perlman just trying to get someone to say something stupid so you can laugh at us. I thought you were better than this Ron.

Don‚Äôt cut to far down or it will unravel
Retrohale when someone offers you a taste
Only smoke safari style during a poker game
"What type of cigar do you like.

Do like a regular cut v cut or a punch.

When smoking a cigar enjoy it don‚Äôt rush it.

Have a glass of your favorite drink on hand when smoking your favorite cigars. 

Keep them in a humidor. 

Humidity Levels for Cigar Storage
If you can, it is best to keep cigars between 65% and 72% humidity. Humidity levels that are too high can result in mold. While these percentages are precise, they are generally seen as the safe humidity levels that will prolong the lifespan of your cigar.

This answer was on Google so I did the homework for you lol. Good luck. Welcome to the club of cigar smoking. By the way a great magazine to pick up or subscribe to either way it‚Äôs called. Cigar Aficionado

"First rule is to enjoy, if you ever aren't it's okay to stamp it out and try another time"
Don‚Äôt sniff the cigars in a cigar shop.
Don't be offended if a friend doesn't finish the entire stick you gave them. Cigars are not for everyone.
Don't insert into the anus is always a rule to live by

"England*

Try the Wellesley. Lived in London for 2 years and I smoked everywhere. This is odd. Where did you go to?"
It's been like that in the US since the early 2000s.  You can't smoke in someone else's workplace here for the most part.  The only exception are cigar lounges and they are not legal to have in every state.
"You can filter on terraces and lounges on this search page

"Finding certain Cubans is becoming more and more of a struggle, even here in Europe.  My two favorite smokes are the Partagas No.4 and the small El Rey del Mundo demitasse (the Cuban ones, not the Honduran).  I haven't been able to get them from any online retailer in my country (The Netherlands) for the past 6 months.    Yesterday I hopped on my bicycle in freezing temperatures, and visited around 10 cigar stores in  town in an epic quest for the No.4.

One store had 3 No.4s left, and another store had 3 Rey del Mundos left. One had a last small box Partagas Capitols which I took as well.  The others had nothing. All gone and no delivery in sight. This is it for my entire city of 500.000 people.   Going to save these for a while."
"Excellent. The No. 4 is one of the kings. Fantastic smoke. Unfortunately, quite expensive. The shop I went to had a couple left, but the wrappers were cracked due to handling as they were the final examples. Picked up some Bolivar Royal Coronas instead. Smoke on, brother!"
Nice. Both are on my list of favorites.
"I've had the partagas no.5; authentic Cuban.  Since I'm a full-bodied smoker, it felt very light and was enjoyable."
"I was on a cruise ship recently , and cigars were not allowed in the casino, but cigarettes were. Thought that was a rule that didn‚Äôt make much sense."
It's the same in Canada they lump cigars in the same category as cigarettes.  They tax the hell out of them to try and make it as difficult as possible to afford to purchase them.  It's just An excuse to say they try to keep kids from getting addicted.  I don't think I've ever seen anyone underage smoking full size cigars.
Here in Florida they outlawed smoking cigarettes on public beaches but allow hand rolled cigars
There are lobbies in the US for that but I think everywhere else tobacco is tobacco. There just doesn‚Äôt seem to be an active industry lobby in other countries. At least nothing visible at the industry level news.
"Yes, specifically admiralty law distinguished them very directly."
"So they are outright banning them for people born after 2008? Does that imply that when the last person born after 2008 passes, there will be no more legal tobacco in NZ?"
"Sounds like a totalitarian government that knows better than you, that will not hesitate to strip you of your liberties."
"This is what happens when socialism takes over countries. You don‚Äôt get the choice, the freedom to make your own choices. They slowly take everything away under the guise of safety."
This is the year that Black & Milds get 1st place. I can just feel it
General notably absent from 2-10 and EPC had another release in their series that have all landed at 1 or 2.
Gimmick of the year. Can‚Äôt wait
Let‚Äôs try and keep it in here so we don‚Äôt get too many threads about it.
H Upmann No.2 it is.
So Rocky Patel is the #1 NC of the year. Haha what a joke.
What an absolute shocker this year!
Definitely not what I would've ( or anyone it seems) expected
Upmann No. 2 shows only one thing: their obsession with figurados. I mean cmon they pick cigars that you can visually determine what it is. Blind tastings?!?  Sus
"If I had 5 guesses as to what the #1 is going to be:
1. EPC La Historia
2. AJ New World Dorado
3. Olmec (wishful thinking)
4. Cuba Aliados (EPC)
5. Casa Magna (dark horse pick‚Ä¶but they scored one highly this year and Quesada needs the press)"
About the only thing I like about these lists is that it helps me justify trying new cigars when I can‚Äôt get my hands on a Padron 1926. They‚Äôre also good for finding decent ‚Äúvalue‚Äù cigars when I have to replenish the humidor I keep for non-regular cigar smoking friends.
"Cuba Aliados Torpedo by Oliva/EPC will be your winner.

Totally makes sense with how much love EPC gets from CA too

I thought Undercrown 10 had a shot but didn‚Äôt get a high enough rating."
"11-25 is where you see the actual good cigars, no advertising needed for those slots"
"It‚Äôs hilarious how butthurt y‚Äôall are. You‚Äôve smoked some good cigars this year‚Ä¶ok got it, that doesn‚Äôt mean your favorite cigar should be on this list because YOU liked it alot. All this shit is subjective, and yes I still believe Cubans are the best, I‚Äôve never smoked a new world that came close to a Bolivar belicoso or a Partagas no. 2."
My guess for #1‚Ä¶. LFD Solis Toro Extra
Acid Kuba Kuba is my number 1 pick
"Cigar of the year doesn‚Äôt mean shit. It doesn‚Äôt make sense that he list changes so much when all of these entries are old as shit blends that haven‚Äôt changed. I literally don‚Äôt understand how the list changes year to year when they are comparing the same cigars every year.

Room 101 13th was an amazing cigar that actually released this year (or close enough if you want to get technical). For anyone interested this is the real cigar of the year imo."
"oliva, padron, fuente, and two cubans‚Ä¶shocker‚Ä¶let‚Äôs encourage Habanos SA‚Äôs price gouging by giving them cigar of the year. cubans shouldn‚Äôt be allowed on this list, 

padron, fuente, and oliva are all big advertisers, so that‚Äôs no surprise ‚Ä¶anyone with even half a clue of what‚Äôs going on could‚Äôve guessed this list in their sleep"
"Damn, cigar number one is ¬£32 in my country. ‚Ç¨14 plus flights to the EU as well ü§¢ 

Good to see Cuba take the crown though. Definitely the best flavours out there üëå"
CA has so much bias it hurts. I need sponsorship disclosures before I believe anything they say. Also why include Cubans when their market is mainly Americans and we cant even reliably get them?
#1 has to be the Olmec‚Ä¶.. right?  Or did Foundation not send them a check?
Could be worse...
"IMHO, shouldve been **Olmec** or **Plasencia**."
I guess they like big cigars and Cubans.
"When someone mentions ""Cubans"" I usually roll my eyes and tune out.  But I at least want to try some cuban blends and I can't.

The embargo happened when my parents were children.  I wish we'd end this nonsense."

A Bradley cigar made the list? Roffll.
Is that the **Avion 13** or the **T110**?
"I got it last year. Not worth tbh, it‚Äôs the same kind of cigars they put in Cigarfest assortments"
"CI uses these to clear out their slow moving junk that no one wants. 

&#x200B;

I'm not opposed to mystery samplers as there's usually a gem or two in them that pays for the sampler and I like variety. But I'll never buy them from CI, been screwed too many times with nothing but unbanded crapola and short filler cigars."
A mystery sampler?  Always a hard pass for me.
"They claimed it was all ‚Äútop shelf‚Äù on their instagram and the picture they showed the bin they were picking from was full of acids, and Camachos if you look closely. I don‚Äôt dislike Camachos at all but stating Camachos and Acids are top shelf is bananas."
Hard pass
"CI‚Äôs brick and mortar super stores are amazing.  If you‚Äôre close to one, definitely check it out.  

As far as an online retailer, there‚Äôs plenty who do it much, much better"
Expect it to be their brands only and ones that are already on clearance
If you read the reviews on their website a couple people listed what they got. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs really worth it
"Hey wanna buy some amazing cigars? These are the cream of the crop. I won't tell you what any of them are, but just trust us. How many will that be?"
"Saw it. Thought about it. Read some old threads here.

Bottom line from what I was reading was never buy the grab bag specials. Always usually junk. That's what I'm going with."
I bought one. I love a fun gamble. We'll see what's in it when it gets here. It already shipped which I was impressed with.
"""We put one fairly good stick in there so you don't feel bad about the crap we can't move any other way than not telling people what they're buying.""

They all do it.  Just stay away from ""mystery packs""

EDIT:  Actually, if you're a new smoker I'd say it's worth rolling the dice.  Learn what you like by trying a lot of stuff.  Don't ignore cigars just because other people say they're bad, find out Gurkhas are awful on your own.  We all had to pay our dues, you should too."
"I'm fairly new to this but in my short time on this sub I have noticed that people here never mention anything positive about CI. It never comes up on the lists of good online retailers, and I'm honestly confused as to why. I've gotten a couple excellent deals and had no issues with quality, but again I've only made a few orders from them"
"No, this is their way of moving the crap. CI is the walmart of cigars!"

It‚Äôs sweet that you took the time to pick a stick out for your dad, and you chose a fine smoke.  Just because your dad said he smoked a certain cigar and liked it doesn‚Äôt mean he won‚Äôt enjoy another just as much or more, and because it‚Äôs from you, that may very well turn out to be the case.

Please just be sure that you keep the cigar in a secure environment like a ziplock if that‚Äôs not the way the shop packaged it for you."

"Last I heard Royale msrp ...

Edit bc I was totally wrong. I confused w different line. I think their msrp s are both In the 20s $ range. Neither of them are the Cuban brand which I assume was in the movie"
"I smoked them both recently. Although I am not a big fan, their taste is not too far off. Both are pretty bold and leathery with some coffee and earth notes. The price isn't too much off marp, however they are often around 5$ each online. At $30 you could likely get him a Cuban Cohiba. I suggest, if you feel like spending an extra 20 and are in the states go to a cigar shop and get him a Padron Maduro 64. His taste buds will appreciate the upgrade."

"There is no right or wrong answer with cigars. It‚Äôs all about what he likes. Order off the internet. Find what he likes. Order more. You can get a Tupperware container (Rubbermaid Brilliance) cheap off Amazon (humidor). Throw some Spanish Cedar in it. Get a govee hygrometer, $12. Cutter or punch and a good lighter. Enjoy."
"I really like cigarpage, especially since I'm also just starting out. Easy place to snag a variety for really reasonable prices. 

Get him a nice cutter and/or a small travel case/humidor type thing while you're at it. I know one of the Nub sets comes with a punch cutter i absolutely loved so that could kill two birds with one stone."
"There are many reputable online retailers that offer great deals and offer shipping nationwide! We happen to be just one of your options üòâ 

  
A couple of tips for broad-stroke purposes:   
\- There are a lot of great choices for premium cigars available in the $5-15/cigar range. $20+/cigar are typically bought and seen as a special occasion or higher-end cigars.  
\- With cigars, price does not always represent the best quality/value. It also comes down to personal taste in regard to value.  
\- Everyone's taste is personal and different, so you have to find what is best and most enjoyable for you and your husband!  
\- A great option would be to start with a sampler. These are bundles of different cigars (either different blends, or brands) that allow you to experiment and see what you like and what isn't for you.

  
It can be overwhelming when you're just starting out, so we are happy to answer any questions. You can also find a lot of useful information for beginners on our YouTube channel, including a [""Top 10 Cigars for Beginners""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Df1KjcBDbuI) video, all the way down to the basics of how to cut and light cigars! Hope this is helpful."
In the ‚Äúabout‚Äù section of this subreddit there is a list of online retailers and cigar recommendations
"That‚Äôs a ‚ÄúNew World‚Äù cigar and not a Cuban. Plenty of good cigar shops (B&M stores and on-line shops) to chose from.

My first bit of advice is to stop in to a B&M (brick and mortar) to get some recommendations based on what you had (Aging Room Quatro) and what you liked about it. However, seeing your comment on middle-of-nowhere indicates that‚Äôs a non-starter.

Second bit of advice would be to read some reviews of what you smoked and determine how the reviewer‚Äôs thoughts/descriptions strike you based on your experience. From there, look up other cigars with similar profiles. Keep in mind, it‚Äôs unlikely that you will find another that is just like ‚ÄúBrand X‚Äù. There will be similarities and differences between all cigars even when they are similar in makeup, style, and profile description - maduros to maduros, natural, Connecticut, etc.

A good bit of advice I had received, forgotten, then re-read here is to read lots of reviews and follow more closely those reviewers whose taste more closely matches your own. Just because you and I enjoy similar cigars doesn‚Äôt mean we are picking up similar tasting notes or that we like the same notes. But find the reviewers who seem to share your likes and pick up similar flavors.

This I s an interest that takes time to develop - to figure out what you like and, just as importantly, what you don‚Äôt like.

All that said, look at some reviews of the Aging Room you had. Consider the described profile. Then look for similar in a small pack or a small assortment of cigars that fit that profile and give it a try. Five packs can be picked up anywhere from $25-$100, and well over. Likewise, picking up a few different singles to try can run similarly up to and over $100."
"Hello, so 65 dollars per cigar I'm hoping is a typo. I'd stick to the 8ish dollar range. To start, since there are no shops locally; I'd get him a Patio or Xikar cutter and a sampler off of cigar page, and a Tupperware with Boveda packs."
"The aging room cigar if you want more...

I always recommend buying samplers, it's the best way to try a lot of styles and strengths.

https://www.cigarpage.com/samplers.html"
Get him a box of plasencia alma fuerte sixtos. They are fireeeee . They retail $20 a stick but you can get em $15-$18 online
cigarbid and cigar page 4 legal non cuban cigars
Opus x or no4 don Carlos a 1964 pardon presidents any davidoff
You‚Äôre awesome first of all. Second of all if you liked the aging room then try the AJ Fernandez Bella Artes. The vibrato refers to the size and or shape of the cigar. Google ‚Äúcigar shapes and sizes‚Äù and you‚Äôll learn all you need under google images.
The real question is are they smoking how you like?
It's what temp and Rh that I keep all five of my thermoelectric cigars at.
Sorry man but u missed out on the cigar page deal‚Ä¶ $70
"https://foxcigar.com/shop/cigars/oliva/serie-v/serie-v-135th-anniversary-edicion-limitada/

Got mine at $89.98 no additional tax or shipping. Very excited to get them in"
Great buy
Not as good as the Melanios imo.....
I wish I was in the US. Literally 6x cheaper üò≠
Everything out. Contaminated cigars in a separate Tupperware. Disinfect the wood.
That plume seems to be heavily concentrated to that one spot /s
"What's temp keeping at?

For me, Cubans I have with 62 packs, NC all at 65, all in tupperdors/pelican for boxes/acrylic Boveda humidor for Cuban singles. All in finished basement that hovers 66-69 temp. Never an issue"
Make penicillin
Quick! Smoke all the other ones before they get moldy!
"What a treat!

That means you get to smoke that stick now"
Nothing a flamethrower cant fix.
"This may sound crazy, but because of the big ass hole being there as well, I‚Äôd guillotine it below the mold and if not molded all the way through, smoke it backwards. 

If I had to bet one way or the other, I‚Äôd vote that this is photoshopped, but if it‚Äôs not, I fully expect at least that cigar to be fully molded inside."
"Give them to me, I‚Äôll smoke em"
"This makes my heart sad.

Time to go check on mine! Fuck this sub tropical climate haha."
Looks like bad photoshop
"Nasty obviously wipe it off and check the foot, tuppidor always hold more humidity then normal"
You will have to smoke them all in one day now before it spreads.
"Yup, throw out the mouldy sticks. I would personally dry box the ok cigars for a week and then put them in a tuppador with a 62rh bovida pack. 69rh is a bit too much for me (the higher you go with rh the higher your risk of mold is). I would throw the old humidor, I could never trust it not to be contaminated. Get yourself a hygrometer if you don't have one. And if you do have one calibrate it, they rarely read true. I keep my cigars between 62rh-65rh and have never had mold. As the seasons change I change bovida packs to keep my rh where I want it. Summer I can use a 62r rh or a 65rh bovida just fine but in the winter it's very damp where I live so I have to change to a 58rh bovida to keep my humidor sitting between 62rh-65rh. Hope this helps.."
Cubans should be at a lower humidity like 62
"Look at that *PLUME*. Sell it to a B&M that specialises in selling mouldy cigars as plume and bam, all your money back. /s"
Toss them those are cheap cigars.. not even worth it
"Dumb theoretical question; if you put the remaining sticks in a sous vide bag and heated them to like 180F for an hour, would the pasutrization kill any spores and not mess the sticks up too much?"
You have a twenty-three nineteen (2319) on your hands.  Follow [this process](https://youtu.be/cUFJ1yVhJ6g) and you‚Äôll be fine.
o7
Burn everything. Start over.
"I often wonder how many cigars are wasted because of this. It is not mold. Cigar mold will never be white. Your cigars are in perfect condition and have simply crystalized. It can be wiped off and smoked with no problem whatsoever. Look it up, don't take my advice, just do your due diligence before wasting a literally perfect cigar."
Why is their desiccant in there
Looks fine just get rid of the silica gel packet and buy a couple small 69% bovedas for that john boy!
"Depends:

From what I understand, wooden humidors (the cheaper ones, anyway) can be hit or miss because air can seep through not only the joint between the glass and the wood but also the corners of the humidor. Assuming that hygrometer is calibrated, looks good to go!

Another common issue, though, is garbage analog hygrometers with questionable calibration status. I would recommend getting a cheap digital one. Either with a plain 7 digit display that you can physically see through your glass, or a fancy bluetooth/wifi smart one. Either way, if you feel that the cigars are tasting good, feeling good, combined with your hygrometer being in the green, then you're good to go!"
"~~But~~ Buy a digital hygrometer (Bluetooth or with display, I prefer Govee they make a small disk one that's Bluetooth) and calibrate it. Reseal the glass with food grade silicone caulk. Then see what you get."
"Looks like solid wood construction, which is good. A lot of the cheap ones are MDF with a very thin layer of Spanish cedar. If it has a decent seal you should be able to tell when you close it. It should close softly and push some air out when you close it."
"I got that exact same one from Amazon which I still use. I suggest buying Bovedas and a hydrometer like everyone here suggests because the analog in it is definitely off than the digital one I bought and calibrated. Check on it every so often because it ain‚Äôt airtight which‚Äôll cause the packets to dry up every few months or so. 

Yeah, it kinda needs to be babied but it‚Äôs a price I was willing to pay for sleekness over practicality. It has mixed reviews on Amazon but I‚Äôm pretty satisfied with mine‚Äîperhaps you could look into a tupperdore like many people here do if you want something less high maintenance."
"Ive got the same exact humidor. Wife gave it to me for a birthday so I kinda had to use it. Anyways, after seasoning, I threw a 65 boveda and it‚Äôs been doing great for almost 2 years now. Seals pretty good. Change boveda as needed. Good luck and enjoy."
You‚Äôre better using it as fire wood and sticking your cigars in a ziplock with a Boveda.
"Those hygrometers are notoriously inaccurate.  As others have said, get an electronic one a calibrate it.  Finally if you hygrometer is accurate, 70-72% RH is just too high."
"Does it work, then yes. If not, then no."
"It seems to be full of cigars, which is a good sign."
"Strictly speaking, it‚Äôs an entry level humidor, plus glass tops and externally mounted hygrometers usually make them even more finicky.  But as other BOTL have commented, sometimes you can get decent storage with these humidors.  If you can get a consisten level of desired humidity and don‚Äôt want to upgrade, ride that horse."
See how the humidity levels behave.
Nice lil setup
"I think some would probably recommend those new to cigars to start on the lighter end of things, which My Father isn‚Äôt exactly known for, but personally I wasn‚Äôt blown away by cigars until I started trying stronger cigars. The only ones I‚Äôve tried there are the Flor de Las Antillas and the Jaime Garcia Reserva Especial. I wasn‚Äôt crazy about the FDLA, I much preferred the maduro variation, but it is still a good smoke. I really love the Jaime Garcia and would recommend them to anyone. I have had a Don Pepin Blue in my tupperdor for months now I‚Äôve been meaning to try so let me know what you think."
"Solid choices, enjoy"
It only matters what you think. Nobody else can tell you what you like.
"Nice üëçüèª, looks like a sampler box, haven‚Äôt tried ‚ÄúMy Father‚Äù yet"
"Don't do like I did.   I ordered that same MF sampler, got it, decided it was too pretty to break up the set and ordered singles of all the components.....   The Don Pepin Blue is one of my favorites.

&#x200B;

And yes, I still have the sampler untouched."
"You got some strong but yummy sticks. I got that same sampler. I love the **Original**, **Jaime Garcia** and **Series JJ**. That **Undercrown Maduro** is good but it's strong, also. Start with the **Davidoff**."
All of them are trash. DM me for my address. I'll dispose of them properly lol...
"I ordered this same sampler from fox cigars recently and really enjoyed them, especially the Don pepin blue. My fathers cigars are some of my favorite so good choice here. If you‚Äôre new to cigars I recommend just picking whatever looks appealing and keeping track of the ones you like then do so research on those. Also pairing them with different drinks can be fun and really change the experience"
That‚Äôs a sick kit
"I almost bought this, kind of jealous. Got a big MF sampler tho that I‚Äôm just cracking into. Great cigars, enjoy

The Undercrown Maduro is also fantastic. Haven‚Äôt had anything from Davidoff yet"
Cool that you get a decent cutter and a lighter in the process.  Nice picks. Enjoy.
"Purchased this exact sampler for my brother a few years ago. Great sticks and a nice little cutter and lighter to boot. Enjoy, and make sure to store your sticks properly!"
The Jaimie Garcia was a favorite of mine throughout college. It‚Äôs still a very good one that I enjoy regularly. The Cuban Classic is an absolutely fantastic smoke. Take your time with that one and enjoy it!
Man that‚Äôs real nice. Enjoy those cigars man! üëç
Absolutely STELLAR first cigar purchase.
Wow amazing. My father is just all around a good producer.
"I mean. Sure. But if your first steak is a filet mignon, eating a cheeseburger will never satisfy the same. I would have started more modest and learn how to appreciate, pick out the nuances of flavors instead of buying 20+ doller cigars right out the gate. You will not appreciate them nearly as much as you will later on when your palet learns how to puck up the flavors."
That box is rad
What flavors do you get out of the Argentum? Ive always wanted to try it but typically get outbid on cbid lmao
"Both of the MoW's and the  A-M's are killer sticks!!!!! If you can,  you really need to try them! Absolute bangers!"
"1 x **Ave Maria Argentum Gordo Extra (7""x58)**

1 x **Man O‚Äô War Armada (6.5‚Äùx56)**

1 x **Man O‚Äô War Armada War Horse (6.5‚Äùx64)**

1 x **Ave Maria Reconquista (7‚Äùx54)**

1 x **Ave Maria Divinia (6‚Äùx54)**

1 x **Diesel Wicked (6.2‚Äùx56)**

1 x **Diesel Rage (6‚Äùx54)**

I love the **Argentum Gordo**. So when I saw a great deal on a **Gordo Extra** I had to have it. In fact, all these sticks are oversized. Ive loved every **Man O' War** and **Ave Maria** Ive tried. So when I saw this METAL AF box with some dark oily fatties at a decent price it was easy to say yes. Havent had the **Diesel**s but Im hoping they dont require 2 years of rest like the other ones I bought.

I feel fortunate, I was able to escape **The Cbid Vortex**, before I spent ALL my money."
That‚Äôs a fine box you got there. Those cigars look amazing.
Nothing is expected. 1-2 is courteous. If you come to 3 and haven‚Äôt bought a box yet you may not be invited as often.
"No lounges in Utah but I just went to my first event that my favorite B&M did with Alec Bradley.
They posted it on social media. Open invite.
It was just the rep with a table of their line.  Picked out 9 sticks, was told of I bought one more I got a better discount. Grabbed another and they threw in three more.  Rep was helpful and cool.
Was asked if I was sticking around for the raffle (couldn‚Äôt hang out)

Great experience. Will watch for future events"
"You should buy something from the rep‚Äôs selection to be courteous and try something new. Usually buying a few will get you some free stuff. Often buying a box will get you a lot of free stuff while the rep is there.

They usually aren‚Äôt invite only (some special ones can be), but I always found buying boxes at events are great ways to get a good deal (buy a box at an event for a special discount and get free cigars and swag from the rep). And shops definitely remember which customers come to their events and support the events. Reps do too sometimes, and it can get you special perks. Anything from access to special cigars when they get them all the way to trips to see a factory and fields."
"I can‚Äôt completely answer that but I‚Äôll say this:  I‚Äôve never been to an invite-only event, but I‚Äôve been to a lot of events. My local B&M‚Äôs don‚Äôt hold invite-only‚Äôs. That said, I‚Äôve never had pressure to buy a box, but I‚Äôve always bought at least a couple sticks."
"The lounges in my area they aren't invite only, but some lounges in my area actually charge to get in if you're not a lounge member."
Buy something but you don‚Äôt have to buy a box. If you do buy a box there will likely be swag to go along with it. They want as many people to come as possible. These things aren‚Äôt invite-only.
It‚Äôs fine.
Sure. The wrapper may crack a little but it might still be worth trying.
Light up without worry. Unless you live in the Atacama desert (lowest humidity in the world) that cigar wouldn't have dried out in a week sitting indoors.
Need a pic of your desk
It‚Äôll be fine. Cigars are more resilient than we give credit to
"I'm from WA where humidity is fairly high but, I've had a cigar sitting outside for 2 weeks in my smoking tent. It'll smoke fine."
Youre good. Spark it up.
Puff and release.
I‚Äôve never had one.  If you enjoy them then good on you.   Don‚Äôt care what anyone else thinks.
"My take is that some people, especially people on this sub in general look at infused sticks like cigars w training wheels. Unsophisticated.  Cigar version of Mike's  hard lemonade."
I probably smoke 1 infused to 10 normal sticks. I like the odyssey and M by Macanudo for coffee flavored. The Acid Blondie and Kuba Kuba are pretty good for infused ones.
"I've had a single acid Blondie I think. It was okay for the novelty of it I think, but I prefer traditional style."
"I started with them. Can‚Äôt stand them now. No judgement to people who enjoy them. I don‚Äôt like mixing my bourbon with coke anymore either, same difference really."
I like them once in awhile. Actually had my last acid 20 tonight. I'm gonna pick up more though cause they're really good imo.
"The heart wants what the heart wants. And sometimes thats an Acid Kuba Kuba Maduro. Or a C-Note, especially when pressed for time."
"ACID Toast is one of my favorites, I've smoked many and they can be incredibly delicious. Cold Fusion, ATOM maduro, Ripcord, they're all a lot of fun to smoke.

The ACID Blue KubaKuba, Blondie, etc are more popular but actually my least favorite. They get bitter past the half way point."
"I love infused cigars. 

**ACID Deep Dish**, **Blondie**, **Red Liquid**. 

**Tabak Especial Negra** and **Dulce**. 

**M by Macanudo**. 

**Odyssey Coffee**.

**JM's Rum** and **Vanilla**."
"Have yet to find a NC that I throughly enjoy, these were recommended or had decent reviews. Hopefully the overwhelming spice/dirt flavor I have experienced with previous sticks isn't to present on these. I welcome any recommendations for future purchases.

You did well. I‚Äôd lead with the WSC first.
Tabernacle and Tatuaje are both great.
Very nice haul.
"This is a fantastic set of cigars and a nice range for finding something you might be into, especially with the Casa Cuba on the way.

Foundation and Tatuaje are both brands I swear by. 

I‚Äôve had the Connecticut seed Tabernacle, and it‚Äôs up there for my favorite cigar from Foundation. It does though have some pepper and spice to it and is pretty earthy‚Äîwhich it sounds like is something you were trying to avoid.

If you find the Tabernacle interesting but want something with less spice and dirt, you might consider trying their El Gueguense. It‚Äôs an amazing cigar from them and maybe closer to your palate.

I haven‚Äôt tried the Tatuaje Black, but I understand it‚Äôs one of their stronger cigars. Again, if you find this one interesting but not quite to your palate, I‚Äôd suggest trying the brand again. The Tatuaje Miami Reserva might work for your tastes."
"Have you looked through our [recommendations wiki?](https://www.reddit.com/r/cigars/wiki/cigarrecommendations) If so and you still need help looking for a cigar please state why you havent smoked any of the recommended cigars.

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/cigars) if you have any questions or concerns.*"
The only one in your lineup that I didn't care for was the Ashton White.
"The G Maduro is underrated, IMO"
I forgot to take a 3rd ‚Äúfinal‚Äù stage picture but I was enjoying it so much haha.
"I picked up a five pack of robustos on a whim, early in my cigaring career. I loved them. Rich and smooth."
I‚Äôve got that‚Äôs been sitting in my humidor for a while I‚Äôll have to give it a try for my next smoke
I love the regular G. Need to try the Maduro
"Need to try the G series soon. Just tried the Series V, enjoyed that one and I recently picked up the Series O. I like Oliva cigars so far"
"Big ho for the Cameroon serie Gs, so much so I don‚Äôt know if I even tried the Maduros!
Have you had both?"
Dude what is that thing above your Breeo?
I never know if I should take a chance on an **Ezra Zion** cigar.
"Received this Ghost Pepper in a mystery pack from Fox a while back.  First time having any of the peppers from Viaje. Was expecting 
a lot more of a spicy punch given the name. What I did pick up was a really nice milk chocolate that had a background heat on the palate the whole time. Not the typical spice tingle on tip of the tongue. Really nice smooth flavor , perfect draw and a ton of smoke production. Really enjoyed this cigar."
I've been seeing these a lot lately. I might just have to pick myself one up!
Sounds like a sleeper. Lucky to have had one.
"Great draw. Chocolate black cherry. Spicy rh. Habano smoothness and sweetness. This is the longest sitting cigar in my humidor, the rest made the celo color brown. And, darn it this makes it so much better. Me and my buddy (heater) are going to enjoy this üòâ"
I got a great deal on these. Then I couldn't bring myself to have more than a few of them. Glad to hear you are enjoying
I used to get these in a lancero and I enjoyed them.
"Normally im a Fuente guy, but one of my local B&M has aged Padrons. Since everyone on here says a Padron with age on it is amazing, I figured id give it a go. Yall ain't wrong, its really good. $8 for the stick and i think im going to go grab more."
Truly one of the hardest working cigars in the industry!
"**ACID** is a polarizing brand. You either love it or hate it. I love it. Created in a room full of botanicals and essential oils, **ACID** delivers a unique experience for fans of infused sticks. Im a big fan of the **Deep Dish** and **Blondie** so Im expecting a lot from this cigar. On to the review!

**Source of purchase:** cigarbid.com

**Size:** 5""x50

**Wrapper:** USA Connecticut Shade

**Origin:** Nicaragua

**Binder:** Unknown

**Filler:** Nicaraguan

**Presentation:** Cool looking band makes for high presentation

**Dry box:** 12 hours

**Smell:** Strong clove, strong incense, strong floral

**Dry draw:** Strong clove, strong incense, strong floral

**1/3:**

Strong leather

Strong clove

Medium salted sweet cream butter

Strong floral

**Retrohale:** Strong clove, strong floral, light to strong pepper

**Construction:** Excellent, burned even, no touch ups or relights required

**Smoke production:** Excellent, single and double puffs produce big clouds.

**Draw:** Excellent, perfect amount of resistance

**Vitamin N:** Medium, noticeable buzz

**Value:** Excellent, $3 for a single

**Pairing:** Perfect, with Black Sabbath Snowblind and post-cigar coffee

**Final impressions:** **ACID** knocks it out of the park, again. Strong infused flavors excite the palate and the retro. The strong butter flavor makes this a unique cigar amongst **ACID**'s offerings. The draw and smoke production of this **ACID** is very impressive. Where it loses points is it's lack of complexity in the first third. What it does right far outweighs its flaws. If you love clove cigarettes, you might love **ACID**s, as well. If you dont, youre gonna hate it.

**Overall rating:** 8.5/10

*Thanks for reading the whole review. Whether you agree or disagree with my assessment, comments are always welcome and appreciated.*"
"As controversial as they are, this is the brand that got me into smoking cigars.  Flavourful for beginners but after a while they leave you wanting something more(at least me). I still on occasion smoke a Acid Cold Infusion or Kuba Kuba."
Iommic
My eeeyes are bliiind but I can seeeeEEeee!! ü§òüèªü§òüèªü§òüèª
I *finally* tried one of these last week and I decided that I prefer the Le Bijou over The Judge. YMMV of course
"This is in my top 5 for sure. Over the years, I've realized im a big fan of Sumatra cigars"
She's a beauty.
"I agree, lots of flavor in this vitola"
"Love this cigar man. Interested in what the Aged Anejo version dropping next month is going to bring to the table.

I miss so many of Michigans craft beers. The things I would do to be able a Shorts Soft Parade down here in TX.
Good combo like PB&J
Those are in stock again or that's from last year?
I love that stick.  Haven‚Äôt found them in a while though
"Haven‚Äôt smoked that stick, but I used to love me some Two Hearted.  There wasn‚Äôt much else to do at college in Northern Indiana but drink."
That stick is extremely controversial in my local B&M. Either you love it or hate it. To me it's the worse cigar I have ever smoked.
Kzoo‚Äôs finest brew
"Just had the heart of darkness, I've had much better in that earthy spice and espresso wheelhouse for the money, including most of the cigars that will follow it. 

The La Perla Habana 1515 is an amazing puro that really brings out everything I love about Nicaraguan tobacco. It's peppery, it's funky, and has just the right amount of chocolate coffee sweetness. 

The Mi Querida blue is a more recent favorite of mine. An awesome chocolate bar that I can't stop smoking. 

The Man O War Maduro Perfecto uses my home state's PA broadleaf, and it shows with that leathery earthy wrapper. Kind of wish they made one in a perejo tho, I generally tear torpedos up because I hold cigars in my mouth for the majority of the time I smoke them. 

The Man O War Abomination is my all time favorite AJ Fernandez cigar. Tons of strength, but not a pepper bomb. Just the right amount of heat mixed with toasty notes, molasses sweetness, and a little bit of savoury. 

One of my all time favorite cigars, the La Aurora 1903 Diamond Preferido. It's everything I love and more, and a perfect night cap to what I'm hoping to be a perfect night. 

Sorry for the wall of text, but I didn't want to seem low effort by not posting any flavor notes."
Six cigars in one sitting? You are a beast
Played The Witcher 3 on PS4 a while ago. Great game. Enjoy your sticks.
Such a good game. I‚Äôve been playing Skyrim and really wishing I could smoke while I play!!! Enjoy.
Whoa you smoke while you play? I need to be on that level
"One of my favorites too, but last time I tried to replay I found the controls super clunky. That was on series X though."
Man this is the dream. Wish i could smoke a cigar while playing my video games. (I would more than likely get my ass kicked)
Where do you play that you smoke as well?
Sounds like a good night. Haven‚Äôt played the games but really enjoyed The Witcher books.
Sounds like a good night. I'm actually pretty disappointed because I literally just did a playthrough a few months before the update was announced.
"Loved The Witcher 3, played it years back. Did it add new content for PC or?"
Marathon action tonite eh. Have a blast Geralt!
"I have still yet to finish that game. I love it don't get me wrong but I feel like I have ADHD when it comes to some games. Before WoW's latest expansion (wow will always be my first love) I would play a game for a couple hours. Then swap to another game. Then another.   


Point being is I play Witcher 3 when I'm in the mood for a single player fantasy. How are the Man O' Wars? I lost a couple bids on cbid for some. Waiting for Christmas to see if my family gets me any."
I wish I could smoke and game at the same timeü•≤
The condition of that keyboard concerns me lol
The fans just kill themselves from being so sticky lol.
"""For tonight?""  Jesus Christ."
I‚Äôve beat that game 3 times and I‚Äôm going to beat it again after the update.
"Good God, that's a lot of hours of smoking"
"I‚Äôm gonna wait a little bit for them to work out the bugs before I install the update. Having said that, The Witcher 3 is GOAT. I started playing it back in 2015 and haven‚Äôt played in a while. I‚Äôve decided to fire it back up recently and been playing it all month long."
"I just want you to know this post inspired me to face 6 cigars today. I had the day off, the wife was away....It seemed like destiny."
"This was my first experience with the Highclere Castle cigar. Still arguably an amateur and found it relatively spicy right off the bat. Paired with the Negroni it wound up being a really well balanced experienced and super relaxing. 

If anyone else with more experience feels like sharing their experience with this brand it is much appreciated!"
"Super solid smoke.

I can‚Äôt get the Tik Tok out of my head whenever I read/see/hear Negroni"
"Smoked one for the first time a couple days ago.  Smooth  and flavorful tasting cigar, I smoked it until there was almost none left."
Smoked one last night great stick
Phenomenal Connecticut
"Top Shelf Connecticut, Foundation always on point."
That thing is like smoking silk! One of my favorite sticks when I can find it
Atlantic has Opus as well.  Just got some Sharks.  Limit 2.
"Of course they get them once Ive spent my monthly cigar budget.

edit - Just saw the price. I couldnt afford them before I blew my cigar budget."
My ash is waaaaaay whiter than that!
That is impressive. Like snow.
"Have fun arguing about mold with retailers, not sure you will change any minds."
Wipe and smoke.
Just clean off and smoke
"Super common with Cubans and something to be expected from time to time.  It's not that advanced so wipe it off as you did, and lower the rh in to the mid to low sixties for a good long while and carry on."
I never buy Cubans without checking each individual stick. Have sometimes opened 4-5 boxes in the duty free store to check because I didn‚Äôt like what I saw in the first few‚Ä¶
I had my box of **Monte #5**s inspected for this reason.
"Despite the seemingly decreasing value of Cigar King‚Äôs Motherload samplers lately, I decided to bite on the Saka Motherload. Pretty happy with the outcome.

What do you think about this value?"
"Looks like a great sampler, I think they should add a normal Sobremesa instead of two Br√ªl√©es but otherwise I like it - I think the regular line is even cheaper. That Gordo looks huge."
"I've not tried the stillwell star cigars yet, that's still a solid haul without them."
"I got the exact same lineup of sticks when I purchased the Saka moterload two months ago.  Those Sombremesa's surprised me with how strong they were.  I usally smoke 2-3 sticks a day, and those Sombremesa's had my head spinning."
I mean this is actually true though. Think it‚Äôs just fat separating from the chocolate. It‚Äôs not really reported as something desirable either
"It's not mold though. It's butterfat. 

Honestly that's probably where cigar ""bloom"" came from. 

It's extremely common in cheaper chocolates but it's not harmful."
"I'm pretty sure you were making a joke OP and did not think these were truly similar issues, so I wanted to let you know that at least one person just laughed and moved on and did not try to explain to you why these are not the same in the comments, like apparently alot of people felt compelled to do."
"Not to be argumentative,  but similarities between chocolate bloom and cigar mold are superficial only. Did you read article you linked? Nobody is claiming  that bloom improves the chocolate experience,  like some claim about mold on cigars which they call plume."
It‚Äôs tempered (yes I‚Äôm a chocolate diva as well as a cigar and coffee diva too!)
Who is aging their chocolate? ü§îü§î
"My parents once bought a box of chocolates called ""Chocoholics"" and it had a bunch of cigar-shaped chocolates"
I smoked cigarettes for three decades. Quit cold turkey just over two years ago. Tried one about six months ago cause I was stressed out. The taste was terrible. Didn‚Äôt even make it halfway through and tossed it. Best decision ever was quitting them. My lungs are grateful and my tastebuds actually work again. I much prefer a cigar or pipe tobacco.
"Lol I smoked cigs for years no more though.  I have a pack of Marlboro in the humidor for an occasional one,  though years in between smoking them. It's amazing how the taste improves with 5 years in the humidor."
Compared to small high end cigarillos (which are literally the same price after taxes) cigarettes are gross.
"I used to buy a pack every Friday night and smoke the entire pack that night while drinking. Didn‚Äôt smoke any during the week, I just loved them when I was drinking. Before that I was up to a pack a day. But now I smoke cigars. Love it so much more."
Even if I run out of cigars a cigarette NEVER sounds good. It's licking an old penny thats been used as an ashtray.
"Culture, cost, convenience, habit."
No not at all. They are super nasty.
"I smoke cigars and cigarettes on a daily basis. It‚Äôs not the taste of a cigarette that‚Äôs making me smoke them, it‚Äôs the quick nicotine fix that I need."
"Nice find. Thanks, neighbor."
"$12 bucks‚Ä¶ugh I already bought 5 this year, lol."
Thank you for that. I needed a couple more. üòÅ
Jeez based on the comments here the MORE controversial thing to say would be ‚ÄúI like Arturo Fuente cigars‚Äù lol
"Papas Fritas are the best of the Liga line, and are just as expensive per gram of tobacco."
"The 70/70 rule was the worst piece of advice I was given as a beginner.

(Elaboration)
I'm sure it works for some people, but using it as a blanket rule is a bad idea and depends on climate and preferences. In my endlessly humid mississippi climate, 68%-70% is WAY too wet. Unsmokeably wet. I wasted a lot of decent sticks and had a lot of bad experiences in the beginning while trying to keep things at 70/70. I've been using 65% packs for a while and have had better luck but still have more issues than I feel I should, so I'm about to play around with some 62% packs. I've heard you start to lose flavor below 60% though so 62% is as low as I'll go."
"Liga Privadas are not great cigars. Are they good? Ehh.. Are they worth the price? Nope. 

But remember, taste is subjective as hell. Personally, i dont like them at all"
IMO Aganorsa Leaf has the best tobacco in the world üåé
"when the person at the shop says these house blends are the same as the stick your looking at, there not.

in the begining used to smoke house blends since they were a few bucks cheaper and would do a deal on buying them. after getting 4 that absolutley sucked, we gave up on them. it also could attribute that it was my early days of smoking and was still learning the ins and outs."
Beyond $20 you hit rapidly diminishing returns with cigars. 60+ ring gauge cigars are awful. A properly executed mild-medium Connecticut shade cigar can be amazing.
"A lot of Cubans are kind of bland.

Some New worlds taste like you‚Äôre smoking a stick of pepper.

But we are in an echo chamber of popular consensus!"
No. 9 is better than the T52 üò∂‚Äçüå´Ô∏è
Liga Privada Flying Feral Pig is way overpriced for what it is. $21 or something MSRP. I'd say low teens would be more appropriate. It's a marketing gimmick essentially. It was good. I just am not looking to pay full price for one. The one I had was in a sampler and I felt pretty good about the price of the pack.
"Toscanos are some of the best smokes out there. 
Reasonably priced. Deep flavor with more complexity than more expensive premiums"
"If your lounge is so poorly ventilated that it stings my nose and eyes the second I walk in the door, 50' or more from where people are smoking, you need to fix your vents. That ain't salty, that's unpleasant."
I don't need to see a selfie with every cigar you smoke. It's not a contest.
"Italian tobacco is nice.

Toscano cigars should be tried by every cigar smoker at least once. 

Not a hot take to this group, but to culture outside the community: cigar smokers are among the coolest people on the planet."
"Personally i love Rocky Patel cigars but they can be sucky, they got so many different ones and its not a good thing in my opinion"
"Cohibas are overpriced. I started off thinking they were some magical gold standard, but I‚Äôve never found one I liked well enough to justify their cost."
Oliva has been riding the V melanio for too long and the brand has nothing to offer at this point..
"According to the comments here:

Plasencia fields + Plasencia barns + Plasencia Factory + Plasencia band = incredible cigars

Plasencia fields + Plasencia barns + Plasencia Factory + Rocky Patel band = overrated cigars

Plasencia fields + Plasencia barns + Plasencia Factory + Alec Bradley band = tastes like shoes"
San Andreas tobacco is my favorite. I‚Äôve smoked many Cubans and still prefer Mexican tobacco
"Fuente A√±ejo blows Opus out of the water. 

Oliva is massively overrated on this sub. 

From top to bottom, Padron is the best cigar brand in the world. Hitters at every price point."
"Yes, we've had the Oliva V. It's fine, I guess. There's way better out there at the same price."
"I think a lot of cigar smokers start off with badly blended cigars or budget sticks that are harsh and have muddled flavors that when you smoke a premium cigar like davidoff, higher end Fuentes, Padron, etc. that are made with aged tobacco and are smoother tasting with a few notes they think they are boring when that‚Äôs what the blender is going for."
"Cubans aren‚Äôt better or worse than NC‚Äôs, but they are different."
"Too many boutique cigars have terrible burns and draws. The importance of humidification is overstated. Even average to kinda shitty cigars sometimes age really well (over the course of years). Natual wrappers are better than Maduro. Oliva Gs are some of the most cubanesque cigars I've smoked. Cuban Romeo and Juliettes are kinda flavorless, and cuban Cohibas are highway robbery. Some Cubans are 100% worth the hype."
"Smoke what you like. Cuban or new world, DTT, Cohiba, R&J, White Owl, whatever the fuck you like, smoke the one that makes you happy. 

I came here to argue with the guy that said DTT  wasn‚Äôt great, but you know what, it doesn‚Äôt matter. 

The thing about cigars, for me, is there are sooo many to try, and there are some I keep going back to, and if you don‚Äôt like them, then you smoke the ones you like. 

And that is just perfect!!"
New world cigars > Cubans.
Alec Bradley sucks
"Undercrown is unimpressive and at times, outright bad."
Lanceros are just as overrated as large ring gauge cigars
"If you get a cigar, and it doesn‚Äôt smoke well, it‚Äôs not because it ‚Äúneeds rest‚Äù it‚Äôs just a bad cigar."
Most ‚Äúboutique‚Äù cigars are just regular cigars with $12 bands.
Giant ring gauges (60+) look ridiculous and don‚Äôt taste any better than their smaller counterparts. Give me a 48 any day.
Alma Fuerte has been consistently putting out the best cigars
Friendly reminder to sort by controversial...
Cheap cigars are perfectly fine and you can enjoy them much more often.
"1. Curivari has yet to make a bad cigar. 

2. Drew estate has gone downhill"
"Fully lifting the Cuba embargo would be disastrous for the Habano market everywhere. Cuba can barely supply global demand as it is, last thing they need is finally being open again to the biggest cigar market. This will cause prices to accelerate even faster everywhere else partly because of Habanos' penchant for price gouging and partly because there will genuinely be less supply. Don't get me wrong I wholeheartedly oppose the embargo"
Aging cigars is dumb. Light em' up!
"Bundle cigars aren‚Äôt a good value.

Fuente and Liga Privada are overrated."
Massive cigars usually burn like crap and aren‚Äôt worth the money.  Also I like a bunch of ghurkas.
"Apparently this is a hot take here:

Davidoffs are fucking delicious, Fuente Short Story and Eye of the Shark and a bunch of others are outstanding while others aren‚Äôt as good because they make a shitload of different sticks, and a lot of people are trying to justify being cheap by knocking good cigars. 

Like what you like and what you can afford. No shame in the game."
Cigar photos don‚Äôt need to be OVERLY photoshopped‚Ä¶or at all
Any My father blows any fuente limited release out of the water.
"99% off CBid ‚Äúhauls‚Äù shared on here are are full of dog shit cigars 

Anyone who‚Äôs smokes a Factory Smoke and states it‚Äôs ‚Äújust as good or better than [any premium] cigar‚Äù has not developed or will never have a palate for tasting what a premium cigars has to offer

Any cigar smoker who shits on another for being able to taste any thing other than tobacco and pepper sounds pouty and miserable.

there, happy?"
Not a fan of corojo wrappers
Cigars only work with fire
"The Feral pig is the best cigar I‚Äôve ever had, and I‚Äôve had most cigars that are lauded as the ‚Äúbest‚Äù around these parts. Not saying those aren‚Äôt good - I‚Äôm saying the Feral is the best I‚Äôve ever had."
"I had an AF Short story a while back and was not impressed, in fact I've had cigars half the price that I enjoyed more. üòí"
Fuente is one of my favs
Have you ever had the god of fire serie B?
Bigger ring gauges suck. More filler tobacco and they rarely burn well
Saka‚Äôs cigars > Cubans
There hasn't been a great or exciting Davidoff release since the 50th diadema.
"People who talk about ‚Äúvalue sticks‚Äù and hate on premium brands are just salty they can‚Äôt get the good stuff. You asked for a hot take, there it is"
"Lanceros are an overrated vitola

Whisky is a poor pairing with most cigars, it overpowers the flavor of the cigar

You‚Äôre not special because you can‚Äôt taste the flavors of a cigar, stop acting like it

Edit to add: less cigars exactly but cigar culture: the whole ‚Äúhaw haw my WIFE ü§™ü§™ü§™‚Äù shtick is cringe tier boomer ‚Äúhumor‚Äù"
"It pains me to say it, because I do love the twang‚Ä¶. But 90% of Cubans are overrated."
"Like what you like. Price is not directly associated with enjoyment of a cigar. It‚Äôs more tied to marketing.

This implies that inexpensive cigars can be as enjoyable or better than expensive ones. This is true.

However, this does not mean that expensive cigars are not enjoyable, not as good, or not worth it. They can be very enjoyable.

It just means there isn‚Äôt a direct correlation with whether or not you will enjoy it.

Enjoy what you enjoy. If you like Gurkhas, I support you liking Gurkhas. If you like Acids, I support you liking Acids. If you like Cohiba Behikes, I support you liking Cohiba Behikes."
Price doesn‚Äôt dictate quality.
"Cubans are vastly over hyped and not worth paying a premium for. 

Very few cigars are really worth more than $15 

I‚Äôm a huge bourbon nerd but whiskey is generally a really lackluster pairing for cigars."
"Cubans are vastly over hyped and not worth paying a premium for. 

Very few cigars are really worth more than $15 

I‚Äôm a huge bourbon nerd but whiskey is generally a really lackluster pairing for cigars."
Cubans aren‚Äôt worth the price
Factory Smokes are horrible at any price.
V-cuts are training wheels for people who can't use a straight cutter.
Nubs and lanceros are the bomb
"All the popular ""maduro dark heavy earthy coffee"" jive talk for poular cigars just means they tast like dirt."
"Acid cigars are garbage.  Tastes like putting a pack of Sweet and Low in my mouth.   Smoking one right now.  To be fair, it‚Äôs getting better as the disgusting sweetness is fading."
Rocky Patel absolutely sucks.
CAO and Esteban Carrera are underrated
"I like Gurkha cigars. Seems like people like to shit on them but everyone I‚Äôve tried has been good. Also, I wrote a nice note to them about how I liked their cigars on instagram and they sent me a free t shirt and an $80 lighter. Much respect for that."
Herrera Esteli Lanceros are better than any Cuban I‚Äôve ever had.
Rocky Patel makes a good cigar. You guys are just snobs
Everything I‚Äôve learned is a lieeeeeeeeeeeeee
OG/OR are always better
"Cigars are not just big cigarettes. 

Not a hot take here, but it's mind blowing to people outside the cigar community."
I hate when people refer to cigars as sticks. It makes my skin crawl for some reason. Absolutely hate it. Sounds so GD stupid to me.
"From what I‚Äôm reading in these comments, this crowd can‚Äôt taste anything short of Nicaraguans that punch them in the mouth. Y‚Äôall aren‚Äôt to the point of appreciating nuance from Dominican, Honduran, or Connecticut-wrapped cigars."
"Fuente cigars suck, no matter how alright Carlito is. 

People who bash Cuban cigars have had a bad fake or are doing it just to look cool. Sure, there's good and not so good ones, but the entire country's cigar production isn't shit. 

""Machine assisted"" smokes aren't bad for yard or work sticks. 

Samplers are almost never worth it. 

Manufacturers like Ezra Zion/Nomad who produce ""ultra rare"" cigars and ""only have enough tobacco for 393 cigars"" or ""pulled these from our private stash"" are more full of crap than a Christmas turkey, and are laughing all the way to the bank while you paw over the forced scarcity."
Cohiba Red Dots are overrated and overpriced
Ghurkas made by the company themselves are great
Large gauge cigars suck
"Hot take and rant: That filter tip cigars aren't real cigars. They're cigarettes, with coarser tobacco  and filter tip (on top of the fact that people who smoke em  INHALE THEM). 

And I hate how people play the equivalency game here with the obligatory 'you like what you like' line as if this ain't a 'for real' cigar sub. This crime is equivalent to being on a sub for craft beer or ales, and some jaggoff keeps posting frothy glasses of Budweiser or Pabst Blue Ribbon. The hell is that? 

Just because something kinda looks like a stick don't mean it's one. Don't care if it was your gateway to real cigars, White Owls, Swisher etc al aren't cigars."
"u/Relative_Reference52

Plaintiff,

v.

u/kimbolll

Defendant,

This case is to be seen in the District Court of Santiago, Dominican Republic, and arises from the wrongful slander of Arturo Fuente Cigar Company. The Defendant claims that the Plaintiffs opinion is false, and seeks damages up to and including a box of Rare Pink as reparation. This case is set for trial on the imaginary day of Wednesday, February 33rd and will be presided by Judge Arturo Fuente, Sr.

Disclaimer: Not a real lawsuit, don‚Äôt sue *ME*!"
"Every time I see someone smoking in their car, I cringe. How someone could ruin the interior of their vehicle because they can't wait until they're stationary to light up is beyond me.

Everyone wanting to outdo one another with how big their stick is it how strong the flavor is making cigar smoking worse overall.

There's a fine line between collecting a good amount of cigars and hoarding enough of a personal stash to open your own B&M. The latter makes you look like a hoarder.

I mostly support tobacco control legislation and while I know it's gone too far in a lot of regions, it's worth it to not have every building basically be a smoking lounge."
Young smokers worry more about humidity and storage more than they actually think about smoking the damn cigar.
Same Arturo. But also it is very rare that a cigar is actually worth more than 15 bucks...expensive sticks are just to flex your cash in a weird way
"Stop selling cigars without cello. (I'm looking at you Tatuaje, Padron, and Drew estate) it's annoying. Any time I go to smoke and have a broken or damaged stick, theres a 90% chance it didn't have cello on it. Also they get beat to hell at B&Ms and some sellers will even slap price tags right on the band itself. Sure, they look sexy in the box, but it's just not worth it, especially for B&M stores. 

Also I 100% agree that Fuente is overrated. I like the Casa Cuba and Don Carlos, but everything else is either boring or not worth the effort to find."
Rocky patel is over rated
All Connecticut's taste like you French tongued a cedar tree.
Gurkhas taste like fresh roadkill on a hot Texas  country road.
Never had a Davidoff that was anywhere near worth the price
"Steve Saka is a liar, moreso than the others.

Creme brulee is 100% artificially sweetened and its actually comical that he thinks (and sadly is correct) the avg cigar customer is dumb enough to believe him.

Opus is wildly, wildly overpriced and overrated imo. I'm well aware I'm mostly alone in this view. Well made cigars and quality tobacco, but not the jewels AF acts as if they are."
Rocky Patel is like the Outback of steak houses.
All tastes and preferences are subjective.
I like Gurkhas.
Regarding CA top 10. Usual gang of suspects. Follow the money
Cuban cigars are overrated
"There‚Äôs no such thing as ‚Äúhot cocoa, roasted walnut, molasses infused vanilla latte essence‚Äù flavor. Just the various shades of the peppery, leathery taste of tobacco. Everything else is a bunch of dudes puffing from the placebo pipe."
"Cubans are overrated.

Rocky Patel is way overrated."
"Cubans are overrated. Also anything above $25 msrp is over priced for what you get. Even then I find it hard to justify spending more than $20 on a stick. Also also, not all heritage brands are bad."
The difference between a good cigar and an average cigar is quite small.
Not of fan of Olivia
There is no way the Le Bijou 1922 Torpedo deserved cigar of the year.
"If all your posts are selfies with a cigar, we realize you are just feeding your narcissism, not really appreciating cigars."
My personal favorite brand is Suck Me Or Sue Me
I once tried to pick up a cigar by the cherry and burned my fingers. That is my hot take.
"IPA beers do not go well with cigars, period. Love IPAs‚Ä¶..but not with a cigar."
"Davidoff, AF, and Ashton are all way over hyped and not worth the money ü§∑"
New worlders are a bunch of idiot kids who don‚Äôt understand why a Padron is king because they‚Äôre broke children
"Lol a lot of cubans suck hot takes. Upvote upvote.

Im actually going to hot take

Any cuban>>almost any nc. Although these days the cost does make it more difficult to justify. Had hundreds of boutique ncs and give me a Lusitania, d4, ryj churchill,bbf or a dip 2 any day (as long as its the day i get paid lol)

Fuentes are the best nc by a country mile. Probably cause they taste somewhat like cubans to me. They are just so well balanced. Yes opus are great, but even their regular 10$ sticks are superb.

The padron 2000 is a great budget stick but the padron 1926 etc are not worth the extra money."
"- A real Cuban Montecristo #2 is actually all that.
- Davidoff is for people who don't like cigars but don't know what else to do with their money and think smoking makes them look cool.
- Rocky sucks.
- Perdomos generally taste exactly the same.
- Rum > Whiskey for cigars.  But Diet Dr. Pepper is the perfect accompaniment.

Gimme an Illusione, Aganorsa, My Father, CAO, La Galera, Fuente (sans the Don Carlos, hurl) or Tatuaje any day."
Cigars aren't as good as pipe tobacco
"Tasting notes are mostly bullshit. Leather, cedar, hay....manure?!? Really! Tastes profiles of hit of shit and dried grass. Ok."
"The **Davidoff Churchill Late Hour Churchill** is boring af.

The **Drew Estate Nica Rustica Adobe Gordo** is the best cigar Ive ever had.

**ACID** cigars are excellent.

Connecticut shade cigars are, usually, boring af.

Heavy metal and a **POST**\-cigar coffee are the best pairing one can have. Drinking anything while your smoking kills the strong flavors that can be pulled, from the cigar.

""Toasting"" a cigar is pointless. Burying the foot in triple torch flame and puffing hard is the best way to light a cigar.

**Factory Smokes Maduro**(\~$1.25/stick in a bundle of 25) is as good or better than many $10+ cigars."
I've yet to have a Padron I liked.
"Cigar reviewers who describe all the different flavors through the ""transitions"" they taste in cigars are full of shit."
Budget NCs are absolutely fucking gross. You people disgust me.
My father cigars are rolled too tight
Oliva is the Klipsch speakers of cigars.  Advertise high prices and discount the hell out of them. Make people think they are getting a deal - for very a middling product.
I‚Äôd put CAO‚Äôs line up against any other brand‚Äôs
CIS special from https://www.cigarsinternational.com are just as good as the authentic‚Äôs they are imitating.
Tatuaje is just an overpriced My Father.
MF arent that great.
"TAA products are generally released in the few weeks to months following the TAA convention.  As for Opus Xs, they are also released at certain times each year.  The core line tends to be fairly full bodied, even if I find them a bit boring.  The forbidden x has been my favorite of them so far."
"So Opus X is a special release except for The Lost City which is more of a regular release.  Fuente releases cigars when they feel like it.  The Newmanns distribute them though, and do a great job of getting them where they need to go.  That said, The Lost City is kind of the red-haired stepchild of the Opus X family.  Special release times for Fuentes could be any time but regularly in November and May, in time for Christmas and Father's day.

Tampa Sweethearts (a shop run by Arturo Fuente Jr) is good for getting some Opus X at off times.  You're still kind of in prime Opus X release time though.  Tour the local B&Ms and look for some.  Ask, they may have them hidden.  If you're online only you're pretty much screwed.  It's not really an online product.

TAA releases happen to the TAA affiliated stores, but not all TAA stores buy all TAA releases.  Some cigar makers release their TAAs close to when the TAA conference is, but most trickle them out through the year.  Check [Halfwheel.com](https://Halfwheel.com) for release schedules."
Not sure where you're at but they're all over Tampa Bay right now.
If you check out Arturo fuente site the have list of retailers in your area. I did this when I moved to a new state and was able to plot five different shops within an hour of me that carried them.
I‚Äôm a fan of Camacho as well. This was a cool collaboration that they did. No longer being made to my knowledge.
"Never had this one and since it‚Äôs out of production, I likely never will. Dang‚Ä¶"
"""Dah Bearss! Who would win in a fight? Coach Ditka vs. a hurricane named Ditka? Coach Ditka!"""
You could beat someone with that bat.
What are the measurements? 8x 70?
"Individual preferences vary but to me 62-65% is perfect, definitely doesn‚Äôt need to be lower. But yeah throw it in and your humidity should gradually get lower."
"I don't own a New Air but I was under the impression they were supposed to be air tight, I wouldn't have expected that much of a difference in the Boveda vs actual humidity"
I also have the newair 250 with about 150 sticks currently. I have 2 69% 320 grams and 4 69% size 60 and it has held nicely for the past couple of months at around 68% . I have hygrometers on both shelves and one on the bottom. They all read relatively the same. Before doing this I had major issues with over Humidification. Using the 72% packs then switched using only a small dish of distilled water when needed. I was trying to keep it at or around 70% but it seemed to be to much. Hope this helps. FYI I have all of the boveda packs in the back on the very bottom.
"I have the same for my aging humidor. I use one of those humidor jars with beads, then a stick with heartfelt and a couple Boveda 65s to control fluctuations since my son liked to change the temp. It's a bit overkill but works great."
Man down!
Any one else deal with cold weather issues?
I live in a cold part of Canada. A few degrees below freezing and don‚Äôt have any issues.
"Was this out of a humidor or from the shop? Never seen this level of deterioration, damn!"
"Cold air, especially if it's breezy, will destroy wrappers.  On the rare occasion it happens I take it as an opportunity to taste the cigar without the wrapper and consider the difference.  Doesn't make me feel much better about it but I tell myself it's all good as I'm doing it for science."
"This is one of the reasons I simply take time off from smoking during this time of year.  I don't want to setup a seperate smoking tent and I rarely go to lounges, so I just use this time to stock up for the year and let everything rest.  If I'm feeling frisky and the weather is >32f then I'll go out as that seems to work for my area (New England), but dry boxing is a must (humidor stays 68-70%rh), trial and error has given me the same result as you when it's below freezing.  Sorry this happened!"
4 seems like a little overkill. Should be good to go though.
"So seasoning is never about a hygrometer reading and all about having the Bovedas in there for the right time.  You can go longer but two weeks, without opening it, should be fine.  If you opened it during the two weeks, the two weeks starts over again from that point."
Yes. Boveda maintains the listed RH with a few numbers to play with either way. Not overkill at all because it won't go past RH. They suggest 1 pack for every 25 cigars your humidor can hold. You're right on the money. That's a well seasoned humidor. Happy smoking.
You should be good to go. My humidity never got to 84 after the seasoning process as well. It's really just about the wood in the humidor sucking up moisture so it doesn't steal the moisture from your cigars once they are inside.
should have only used one 84% pack. let the humidity drop to 70 before you start to put cigars in.
Is your dentist saying my teeth will be good at math?
A good electric toothbrush is a wise investment.
No medical professional will ever recommend smoking anything. Any Dr. or Dentist will probably advise you not to smoke at all because of XYZ. If you brush twice a day and floss daily you're better off than most people even if you smoke. It's a risk-reward thing that you have to consider personally is how I see it. Just take the best care you can. Happy Holidays.
Use therabreath (a mouthwash)
"1. Eat something
2. Mouthwash
3. Brush
4. Mouthwash"
"Not calculus, but linear algebra and differential equations for sure."
Just brush your teeth and get a cleaning 1-2 times a year. My dentist and I exchange cigars.
I have found that the best way to avoid this is with good whiskey and another cigar.
I stopped reporting that I smoke to all Healthcare providers. Dentist still does oral cancer screening but I get to have checkups without lectures or a made up diagnosis.
if I can't brush my teeth I am at least chewing a piece of gum.
I let God deal w it
"Mouthwash, then brush was warm water every time."
"Ah, won‚Äôt have to get a new calculator then- win/winüéâ"
I have no teeth so what‚Äôs that tell ya?
"Mouthwash, followed by another cigar"
Whew. I only got dental algebra. I got off easy.
go to the dentist every 3 months for a cleaning instead of the recommended 6 months.
I mean dental calculus is caused by mineral deposits. I doubt cigar smoke has many depositable minerals. I normally brush after a cigar but i don't reckon they'll do much harm apart from some staining.
"The tobacco build up is real, brushing after smoking is essential. But I do think cigars are one of the keys to longevity"
Definitely invest in a high quality electric toothbrush + therabreath. Oral hygiene after every smoke.
"The after taste  of smoke after smoking is nasty so I brush, mouthwash then gargle some soda."
"Everyone is different, of course, so my experience is my own. I smoke 2 cigars a day, most days. I brush 2-3 times a day. I see the dentist twice a year. My dentist, off the record, knows I smoke. She has noticed no additional issues. I may just be lucky."
I brush mine after every smoke within 45  min
So weird I was at dentist for cleaning tues and mine said the same üòÇ
Sonicare and smartmouth
Been smoking here and there for some years and more consistently for a little over a year and my dentist doesn‚Äôt know I smoke cigars. I floss and brush with activated charcoal toothpaste nothing special
Usually yes as I smoke at night befor bed
I‚Äôm cursed. I‚Äôve been battling periodontal all my adult life. Like someone said earlier I don‚Äôt admit to anything with any health practitioner. I‚Äôm too old for lectures. I make my own mouthwash concoction - 50% mouthwash (with alcohol) and 50 % hydrogen peroxide. Swish that around twice a day. I also started using a water pic a few years ago. I get clean bills of health and no lectures every six months by my dentist.
Yes definitely.  The only reason why I don‚Äôt smoke cigars more often is the taste it leaves in the mouth so I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised at all if they do more harm than just causing bad breath for half a day
"Dental calculus?

Whatever the fuck calculus is, I want as few things in my mouth besides bourbon, sticks, and steak as possible, so brush your damn teeth"
They say that if you brush your teeth and gums including your tounge after smoking cigars then it forces the toxins in faster and they say not to and that can cause your gums to start receding and cause tooth loss
I once had dental algebra after a Partagas.
"I have a very open and honest relationship with my dentist. They know I rub a can of Copenhagen a day, so they don't even lecture me anymore. Cigars are a non-issue at that point."
I usually follow a cigar up with another cigar...
Listerine after you smoke.
Brushing in addition to...
Just brush your teeth with hydrogen peroxide (3% concentration). Will keep your gum healthy and your teeth white. And best of all: The pleasant aftertaste of your favorite cigar is not affected. Caution: You should never swallow it and rinse it properly with plenty of water.
"Rinse liberally with Single Malt Scotch.

Repeat as needed."
Heavy mouthwash also
I rinse thoroughly with whiskey while I smoke and after. My dentist says I have a lot of stain but that's about it.
"Been smoking cigars for the better part of 30 years and nope, nothing like that.  I smoke a wide variety of cigars."
My favorite cigar is the CLE 25th. I actually try to stay away from smoking it on a regular basis so it doesn‚Äôt lose it‚Äôs wonder. The Eiroa Classic or Caldwell Long Live the King are my every day go tos
"Im still in my ""want to try every cigar in the world"" phase. If I had to pick a brand it would probably be **Plasencia**."
That sounds like it would get boring. Variety being the spice of life and what not
"H Upmann Sir Winnie is my favorite, in size and blend. Definitely can‚Äôt smoke that all the time though, only have 3 left!"
"No favorite, I have many favorites that I will buy by the box, but for me a lot of the fun comes from trying new stuff and smoking a variety of cigars"
"All my favorite cigars are limited. So I get really excited when they come out every year, vut there are so many great sticks that I smoke that are year round production."
"My father, my father no. 3 crema."
"The closest thing to that would be Saka's Mi Querida lineup if I had to choose a single cigar or line. The premise of taking the core blend and using it as a baseline to work with the Unbagog, Triqui Traca, and SakaKhan means you have a 4 cigars with slightly different profiles that build off of the same base profile."
Casdagli grand cafe lancero
"I don‚Äôt know about an all-time favorite, but my current fixation is the Rocky Patel fifty-five."
For me it's all about variety and looking forward to new offerings. My daily box stands at 35 SKUs as of this morning.
"I don‚Äôt really have a favorite, but I like most of the Arturo Fuente line, at least the ones I‚Äôve had, the Perdomo Champagne is pretty amazing and I like the Monte Cristo White Label."
"I think the best I could narrow it down to is broadleaf as my favorite wrapper. Favorite cigars SO FAR, although I too prefer a wide variety, might be Dunbarton‚Äôs Mi Querida Triqui Traca 448 and Crowned Heads Le Car√™me"
"Part of why I love cigars is that there‚Äôs an almost unlimited amount of options to try, so I can‚Äôt say that there‚Äôs just one that I would smoke exclusively from here on out. With that said, there are certainly ones I‚Äôve tried that I know I need to have on hand because sometimes you just want to know you‚Äôre going to smoke something you‚Äôre guaranteed to enjoy. Right now that cigar is the Padron 3000 maduro, though I just tried the LFD DL-452 maduro which I might have enjoyed as much as the Padron."
"Plasencia Alma fuerte sixto I - or as i like to call it the honeycomb. Smokes brilliantly. When i first had it, reminded me of a partagas series d no 4

Favorite cuban - partagas series d no 4"
The fun of the hobby is the variety that is out there to try.
"The ""I wanna puff you"" eyes I've been giving my Cohiba Maduro Genios, Monte Edmundos, Pardon 64s been making the rest of the tupperdor jealous."
"Mmm, no. Found two favorites. Still have about 90 different cigars in my humidor. I'm working through some of my singles to move that number down a little. Except if I find something I love then I guess I have to buy more.

And going to by more tomorrow anyway."
"Would say I have a specific favorite but maybe a top 3, mostly a couple Arturo fuente and an undercrown, but still mostly smoke everything"
"Just got into smoking cigars more often and just buying my first humidor, seems like every week I‚Äôm finding a new one that I like. Right now I like the punches and tabak dulces. My Fathers are getting up there but haven‚Äôt tried them all yet and I‚Äôve been hearing good things about the davidoffs too. Feel like I‚Äôm always going to have a new favorite lol."
Plasencia Alma Anything
"There are three or so that I smoke regularly. But I still try new stuff and sprinkle in old favorites all the time. Do you, but I kinda like it that way."
"Thus far, I've enjoyed the RyJ Belicosos the most. I'm a Havana fan, but I wouldn't smoke these all the time, as they're now difficult to find, dear, and the kind of thing I enjoy as a very special treat. The No. 1 and 3 are the ones I smoke most frequently"
"Padron is my favorite brand and I'd be pretty happy just smoking them. However, some occasions are more suited for mild-medium cigars and variety keeps it all interesting and gives perspective."
I don‚Äôt really have a single favorite but I normally gravitate towards anything in a lancero vitola.
I really like their thousand series. Call me crazy but I almost like them more than their more expensive labels
"Thousand series is their every day offering

I prefer the 1964 over 1926.

Every family reserve is special. Special occasion smoke.

The 1926 80th is one of the best cigars ever made."
Any 1926 Maduro. Especially the 80 year
"So here is what you should try in order:

1. Padron 1964 Anniversary maduro
2. Padron 1964 Anniversary natural
3. Padron 3000 maduro
4. Padron 1926 natural
5. Padron 1926 maduro
6. The Family Reserve are a much lower priority. They are not significantly better, just different"
They‚Äôre all good but the Anniversary and Family Reserve series are exceptional.
"The Hammer in natural is the best Padron.  Getting into the brand, try a 1964 maduro in something like the Exclusivo size.  A well rested x000 series is solid as well.  If you like the 1964, then move onto the 1926 series and the special anniversary stuff."
"They‚Äôre all good. The best I‚Äôve had from them is the 50 Years Maduro. It‚Äôs one of their more rare sticks and truly a special occasion, but it‚Äôll ruin you on Padr√≥n if you start with it. Some of the best to start out in their catalogue would be the x000 series maduros, then breaking into the 1964 and 1926 in the anniversary series."
"No love for 1926 No 90 Nautral? Those white tubos man, I love them in a way I didn't think I could love something shaped like that."
64 maduro for me.
64 maduro
"All of them.

All of them?

All of them."
Yes. They are the best.
I loved the 1964 anniversary i had.
"This is what you should try in order.
1. Padron 3000 Maduro
2. Padron 3000 Natural
3. Padron 1964 Maduro
4. Padron 1964 Natural
5. Padron 1926 Maduro
6. Padron 1926 Natural
7. Family Reserve Maduro
8. Family Reserve Natural

Some special ones to consider: 1926 80th Maduro and 1926 40th Maduro. Absolutely Sublime."
All of them. They don't make a bad one. So do you want natural or maduro? Then just decide what price you like. It will be a good cigar.
 If you like Connecticut shade try the damaso
I had a 64 maduro yesterday so good i could of cried in the lounge right there
"My two favorites are 2000 Maduro, and 1964 Exclusivo Maduro. 

There are better ones for -sure- but I love those the most."
Hermosa
Anything 1926
"  My all-time favorite Padron is the 1926 Maduro. Here‚Äôs my list of top Padrons:

1926 Maduro - 97 (milk chocolate)
1926 40th Maduro - 96 (choc/sugar cookie)
Family Reserve 46yr Maduro - 96 (complexity)
1964 Maduro - 96 (dark chocolate)
1926 No. 90 Natural - 95 (whipped cream)

I have smoked almost every cigar from the lineup and reviewed them in detail, if you check out my Reddit account page you can see them all"
Yes. Very minimal rust after years of use.
Stainless is the way‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve had it out weeks‚Ä¶Months? Rain snow whatever‚Ä¶ no rustüëçüèª
"The copper finish gets a patina to it pretty rapidly, but no rust or other issues.  Mine has been outside for at least a couple years."
I had a black coated one- got destroyed after one summer. Wouldn‚Äôt recommend.
No issues with the original model stainless steel.  That would be the pick.  Don't get the other finishes because I have no idea how durable.
not as much as the government wants you to believe.
Yes. Any more so than unflavored cigars? Doubtful.
No more than unflavored likely but the children...
I believe there is a difference between infused and flavored.
No more than normal. ‚ÄúBut if tobacco tastes good more people will smoke which will put a strain on our planned socialist medical system!‚Äù
"Just as much as a regular cigar. 

However, if it‚Äôs your go to smoke, your masculinity levels will drop"
No. Cigars cure many diseases and are part of a healthy breakfast.
I definitely forgot it became illegal again in '20.
"It's your risk to take I guess.  If they search your bag they will take them and tell you how you perjured yourself on the claims form.  That is the likely consequence, plus the hassle."
"I've done it, many times.  I've never had anyone so much as bat an eye.  One box, minimal risk.  Multiple boxes, more risk."
"If you want to take it to the extreme, you could strip the bands and just put them in a ziplock.  Put them in your checked baggage and forget about them."
"Kind of depends on the agent at the gate really. How do they know those are any other country‚Äôs cigars? If they want to pull them out and inspect them then that‚Äôs on them. I‚Äôm sure plenty of people bring them into the US. I thought it wasn‚Äôt illegal to bring the back, just purchase them in the US. I‚Äôll have to double check that I guess."
These are some of the best Dominican cigars out there right now.  Certainly seems like they are doing quite well between what they have done for Caldwell and this brand.  I'm becoming a big fan.
"I‚Äôve gone through a box of their lonsdale and a 10
pack of the lanceros. They are amazing!"
"A member of the new wave of connecticut cigars, the ADVentura Queen‚Äôs Pearls is a Dominican cigar that doesn‚Äôt sacrifice on strength or flavor. If you are a connecticut fan then this needs to be added to your must try list. I personally enjoy the Lancero the most, with the Corona being a close second (Toro and Robusto are also available). 

You‚Äôll like this cigar if you like: Joya de Nicaragua Antano CT, My Father Conneticut, Ashton Classic, Davidoff Grand Cru, Caldwell Savage, Rocky Patel White Label, or AVO Classic. 

I am biased when it comes to ADVentura cigars. They manufacture all of our anniversary releases and master blender Henderson Ventura is a personal friend as well. Bias aside I think they are the most exciting up and coming brands in the industry. 

The Queen‚Äôs Pearls is a medium (edging on medium plus) strength connecticut. Citrus, vanilla and a light floral notes are balanced out with a dry cedar sweetness. It utilizes a complex blend of Ecuadorian, Nicaraguan and Dominican fillers wrapped in a Connecticut shade grown wrapper. The tobaccos are aged for an average of 5 years. In addition to this age, the cigar itself goes through a special fermentation process for an additional 4 months post roll. 

The Queen‚Äôs Pearls was the sister cigar to the Full bodied King‚Äôs Gold (which utilizes connecticut broadleaf) as the Royal Return release. Both cigars received wide praise when they were released a few years ago. The Queen‚Äôs pearls was the number 3 cigar of the year on the Halfwheel 2021 consensus list.

The Ventura family has a long history in the cigar industry. Father William Ventura was heavily involved with Davidoff for a majority of his career before retiring and later founding his own factory. This factory produces cigars for several brands, most notably Caldwell cigars. Unfortunately there was a factory fire in Early October which resulted in over a million cigars being lost. Luckily the family had a smaller factory available for side projects. This turned out to be a saving grace as they were able to transfer production for many cigars to this smaller factory. 

While I suggest the [Queen‚Äôs Pearls](https://renegadecigars.com/products/adventura-queens-pearls?_pos=1&_psq=queen&_ss=e&_v=1.0) or [King‚Äôs Gold](https://renegadecigars.com/products/adventura-kings-gold?_pos=4&_psq=king&_ss=e&_v=1.0) be the first cigar that people try from ADVentura, I smoke every single blend they produce on a regular basis. The brand is unique in our humidor because every single size of every single blend sells a minimum 100 cigars every 90 days. There truly isn‚Äôt a bad blend they produce. 

Marketing wise, I love what ADVentura is doing. There is a whole story line behind the cigars‚Äô name. They produce unique boxes that stand out in the humidor and gained attention at PCA for their newest release offering a talking box. It‚Äôs fresh and new while still honoring the tradition of the industry.

If you don‚Äôt listen to another one of my suggestions - give ADVentura a try. I promise you they have a cigar that will fit into your profile and will make it into your regular rotation.

You won‚Äôt regret it!
Sounds like it was too wet.  I don't find these to have burn issues.  I do have a problem with their relatively bland flavors though.

Improper way to light a cigar but I like the spirit
Her story is totally believable. I accidently lit myself on fire the other day. I like to light my cigars with the flamethrower I bought from Elon Musk's The Boring Company. I was being careless and lit my face on fire. I put it out with a chainsaw. I feel fortunate that the fire never really got out of control.

"I'd love to see something from Dunbarton or Foundation snag the top spot, but I think the chances of that are quite low.

I can think of a few cigars from both that would qualify as among the best I've had this year."
Wait why is Davidoff never on these lists?
My guess is Foundation Olmec Maduro for cigar of the year. Absolutely delicious stick. But I‚Äôd still rate Padron above it
Some great cigars on the list so far. Do they only review new cigars?
Every davidoff I‚Äôve had was underwhelming. Their Nicaragua has been the best so far.
"Easiest way to tell is to see who paid the most for advertising this year in Cigar Aficionado magazine.   If you think they are based on anything but that, I've got some Utah oceanfront property you are going to love."

"Anejo Xtra Viejo Reserva No. 50 - 94.5

Full bodied

Pre-light draw: barnyard hay

First third: coffee and cream, bread, black pepper spice, black licorice, dark chocolate, cinnamon

Second third: powdered sugar, cocoa, allspice,  black licorice and sweet earth on retrohale

Final third: cocoa, graham cracker, sweet earth, creamy black licorice 

Overall: This firmly packed limited release cigar has a beautiful dark, coarse wrapper. Slightly snug draw after the initial straight cut but the burn line was absolutely perfect, and the smoke output was impressive. I smoked it in 30 degree weather with no issues, stayed lit with over 2 minutes between puffs at times. There is an abundance of black pepper spice layered on top of gentler, sweeter flavors. 

This cigar is very smooth, never over powering. Very easy to retrohale. This leads me to believe that these would be great cigars to age for another year or two, despite the extra age already on these beauties - I may pick up a small handful for this purpose. Very unique cigar with a delicate balance of sweet and spicy flavors, keep a look out and grab them while they‚Äôre available - you won‚Äôt regret it!"
"Bought 3, I can not wait until the weather warms up. First beautiful day of spring I'm lighting one up. Thanks for the review!!"
I‚Äôve got a 5 pack of the 888 arriving today! Can‚Äôt say enough about how damn good this entire line is
"Nice review, thanks."
Appreciates the review.
Great smoke with a few years on it!
DTT Sobremesa and Sobremesa Br√ªl√©e (Blue if you can find it)
Joya de Nicaragua Numbero Uno
"While I most often go for a cigar on the lighter profile side (not light on flavor) like the Crowned Heads Mil Dias, Southern Draw Rose of Sharon, Warped La Colmena, a darker profile is not out of the question either.  Nothing too big a vitola though."
Sobremesa Br√ªl√©e with coffee is nirvana.
"Alec Bradley Medalist, Montecristo Classic Series, Ave Maria Immaculata, CAO Black, Drew Estate Isla Del Sol. 

All very light, affordable, and pair well with a vanilla sweet cream iced or hot coffee.

Monte Classic is pretty light on flavor, medalist is very smooth and well rounded, CAO black was very creamy and has more bite, Ave Maria Immaculata is a graham cracker, and Isla del sol is literally coffee flavored. Just my take."
Perdomo Lot 23 Connecticut or Perdomo 10Th Anniversary Champagne are my absolute favourite morning cigars üëå
"Sumatra really carries no flavor (or very little).  It's more of a neutral wrapper, so realistically what you're tasting in these cigars is the binder/filler.

Some of my morning/coffee cigar choices are:

RoMa Craft Intemperance EC XVIII

Illusione Grande Classe Rex

Partagas Shorts or Petit Corona Especiales

Montecristo No. 4 or 5"
Nub cameroon
"Joya de Nicaragua Antano CT
ADVentura Queen‚Äôs pearls 
Partagas Cortado
22 Minutes to Midnight CT
Rojas Street Tacos Carnitas"
**Camacho Triple Maduro**. Start the day off with a bang.
Espinosa crema or DE Herrera esteli habano
Tabak Especial
Rose of Sharon
Rose or Sharon or Perdomo Champaign
RoMa Craft Intemperance WR McFarlane is my current favorite.
In the morning I like something a bit more mild and pair with a very strong coffee. I like a Joya de Nicaragua Cabinetta with my morning coffee.
Illusione 888 claro
"Well you have a taste here that is unfamiliar due to the 100% American content.  Terroir really plays a huge role in flavor and a great example for that is to taste PA Broadleaf vs CT Broadleaf.  Just a few hours drive west of CT and the taste is completely different.  Anyway, I digress.  Is this a gimmick?  Yeah, probably.  Just about everything in the cigar industry is a gimmick these days.  At least it's a gimmick that is substantial, not some kids character on a band or something like that, lol."
"You're talking about the cigar, right? üòÖ"
"I did a [review](https://www.reddit.com/r/cigars/comments/vpx3rz/happy_birthday_weekend_america_the_american_puro/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) of the American and I was impressed. I was not happy with the Caesar, not a bad cigar just had burn issues and not worth the price to me in comparison to similarly priced cigars. Different strokes for different folks."
"I‚Äôve had and used Cigar Oasis humidifiers for a long time. Their quality has gone downhill and their internal hygrometers are very inaccurate and worse they seem to drift further away as they age. I have the latest Excel 3.0 and Plus 3.0 boxed up for the last year and replaced them with a Le Veil unit I found on Amazon. The hygrometer on this is accurate, it uses gel beads in the humidity tank, the seals all have rubber gaskets and is just a far better design all around IME. There is also a free blu tooth app for monitoring and changing levels‚Ä¶ I recommend this over the current crop of CO units

Don‚Äôt bid on anything so I can finally win some bids :-)
Always legit but adds up
"Cigarbid is the devil! Great deals, but they definitely add up and will require a larger or extra humidor."
No. Not counterfeit. Just a large retailer who can afford to lower prices to move stock.
Beware of **The Cbid Vortex**. It's way too easy to bid on a lot of cigars.
"It‚Äôs all genuine merchandise and cigars.  Sometimes, the singles, 5ers and 10 packs won‚Äôt be ‚Äúbox quality‚Äù cigars.  But, that happens when you buy from CI too."
"Wholesale cigar costs are a lot lower than many cigar enthusiasts are aware, especially if they have only ever bought in a b and m"
No never.
U must use the Freefall section - that's where the deals are.
"The deals are legit- filter by ending soon. 
The MSRP price it shows is inflated though.
It‚Äôs a great way to try new cigars."
"Prices can be good, but people often pay a lot more then places like cigar page."
"No, but they're mostly garbage that I wouldn't smoke for free."
Who the hell is going to counterfeit Rocky Patels and the other shit on that site?
So far they haven't shown me a deal worth bidding on.  I see a lot of deals higher than foxcigar.   I'm patient so a deal may come through eventually.
"Save the best for last
1. RP white label 
2. T52 
3. Davidoff Winston Churchill
4. Don Carlos 3 
5. Ashton puro sol
6. La Opulencia"
"Picked up a few sticks for my birthday recently. Haven‚Äôt smoked any of these before, so looking forward to giving them a try. 

Selection below (left to right):

- Rocky Patel White Label Robusto
- Ashton Heritage Puro Sol Robusto 
- My Father La Opulencia Robusto 
- Liga Privada T52 Robusto 
- Davidoff Winston Churchill Petit Corona
- Arturo Fuente Don Carlos No.3

Keen to hear your thoughts!"
I'd go with the davidoff. Nice lineup.
"**T52** 

**MF**

**AF**

**Ashton**

**RP**

**Davidoff**"
"Happy Birthday! Nice haul!

Now since it's your Birthday, I've thought about it and I think you should have the My Father, if you're just having one today. If you're pressed for time, have the Davidoff."
"Nice choices.

You kind of foiled my suggestion of smoking the ones you haven't had before first, but you said they are all new to you. Tough call. I've had the T52 and love it. If I were smoking more than one in a day I'd want that to be the last of the evening.

I haven't had a La Opulencia, but so far My Fathers have been smooth, so maybe a breakfast cigar. 

The rest, I don't know. I have a stash of sticks I haven't tried yet. I alphabetized them and am just going in order right now. Well, maybe. I'm smoking a Herrera Esteli this morning. I have a LP Unico Nasty Fritas on deck. Same theory as your two. I knew the Herrera Esteli would probably be smoother, though not as smooth as that My Father, and it will be my first Nasty Fritas. So I'm going to have it later in the day.

Okay, so that's in no way going in alphabetical order. But I start looking at the list that way until I see something I want."
"Just had the Davidoff yesterday. It was not what I expected and not in a good way, Dry harsh and bitter. Let me know your experience with it!

Thanks!"
The Opulencia is my absolute favorite cigar.
White Label! Those are some great sticks!
"I enjoyed the Ashton Heritage, I got it as part of a sampler and thoroughly enjoyed it. I also really liked the VSG & Sovereign even though all three are very different."
T-52 definitely one of the best cigars. Not of this bunch but in general.
That Winston Churchill to start for sure. White Label on a fresh pallet.
MF is very smooth great strength. One of my faves
Depends on what you‚Äôre drinking and how much!
Yes.
"1 hour 50mins i have to relight 4 times. Try to hold the ash but u can see the result from my pic. Pretty snug draw, require double puffy

Flavor: spice and little earth and coco at fist third. Had some transition at second but can‚Äôt put my fingers on. Last third a little spice and earth. Sometimes i even taste nothing but bitterness. Very clean and short fish is only thing i like. Overall not the most flavorful cigar

Well. I have to say it‚Äôs the worst cigar i ever had based on 4 times relight. Hope it‚Äôs only a bad one. I pay for $6, and I think there are lot better choices out there"
"I had one that was incredible, followed by many that were quite disappointing. Inconsistent at best. The last one I smoked exploded on me and I gave up for good."
I have found the entire brickhouse lineup to be largely bland and forgettable.
That‚Äôs a bummer. I‚Äôve had good experiences with the maduro and the double Connecticut. I can‚Äôt say my experiences were that bad
Overhumidified
Can‚Äôt judge a cigar based on one smoke. You have to smoke several over time to really know. I‚Äôve had complete opposite experiences with cigars that came out of the same box.
"My advice to you is... Stick with Nicaraguan higher end cigars. I never got a bad one.  I prefer the taste. Most cigar smokers can agree that the esteli cigars are among the best and never disappoint. 

Also, almost anything that says ""AJ Fernandez"" on it is going to be good."
"Bummer, almost snagged some of these a while back. Do you have more to try in case you had a bad one?"
"I, too, have had wretched experiences both times I've tried Brickhouse. Much worse than this. Glad you found more flavour than I could."
A while back I went through a fiver that was resting in my stash and I agree with you completely.
Brick house has been a pretty mediocre brand at best every time I‚Äôve tried it
"I grabbed a 5 pack with my last CBid order. Had one and was also very unimpressed, although i was drinking at the time so can‚Äôt really articulate why lol. Gonna let the rest sit for a couple more months before I try again"
"Yeah, had the Maduro this summer - they were freakin awful. They were already dry as hell and cracked bit by bit while smoking until it fell apart. Awful"
100% agree. Those are terrible
Same! Hate it!
"I hope a couple of their double Connecticuts for when I want a Connecticut wrapper. The double wrap really makes a difference and I haven‚Äôt tried any other of their products. Might get around to it but other than that particular cigar, I haven‚Äôt heard the best things about them"
"They‚Äôre typically really dried out because no one smokes them. They aren‚Äôt bad as far as like construction or burn, their taste is just bland. Pretty strong though, one of my first cigars"
I strongly prefer ring gauges at/under 50.
"The reason you get more flavor from thinner cigars is because of the wrapper/binder to filler ratio. Not to say chonky cigars always have less flavor, but the wrapper/binder leaves tend to be more premium and generally responsible for more of the overall flavor profile of the cigar."
I prefer a corona because I always get excellent flavour from them and the smoking time is just right for me.
"I prefer the range of 46-55 and don‚Äôt mind fatter, but I have trouble keeping the very thin ones lit without stoking them too hot and ruining the flavor."
I love dark oily fatties. Give me a **CAO BX3 Gordo** and Im purring like a cat.
"While I don‚Äôt mind fatter sticks, I also find thinner sticks bring more flavor. My ring gauge sweet spot is 48-52."
I stick with smaller ring gauges personally
"Everyone's gonna say thin are better because wrapper flavour, but I'll take as much flavour as tobacco you can stuff in there, thanks. Unhinge my jaw. Nothing wrong with thin, I smoke them too, but gimme a big huge one that lasts forever. I wanna stay like this forever."
"If I can get it in a Lancero, I will."
I like my cigars like I like my ladies: Fat.
"It's hugely dependent on the specific cigar, but if you're putting a gun to my head...

52 ring gauge is my absolute maximum. If I had to pick one do-everything vitola it would be 6"" x 48 (toro)"
I like the Robusto size
"42-52 is my sweet spot. Lonsdale, Corona Gorda, and toro are probably my favorite vitolas at the moment."
44-48 is my favorite so far.
"I smoked 60 gauge cigars almost exclusively for the past fourteen years. Only buying something else maybe 56 to 62 when that's all was available.

I was doing my self a disservice. Many great cigars don't come in this size. I've been branching out. I'm trying mostly not to go below 50. But sometimes. The Liga Privada Uncio Papas Fritas is a great cigar. I'm glad I tried it."
"My 2 favourite cigars with my very short smoking history have been lanceros.

Cohiba aged 10 years
Oliva melanio Serie V rested 2 months"
I like fat cigars because my hands are massive and they break the small ones
"Skinny cigars feel better in my hand, have a more comfortable drawing experience, and big cigars require more frequent puffing which typically makes me sick towards the end."
I had my first lancero recently and really enjoyed it. My next visit to my favorite b&m I'll grab as many as I can to try.
"Cuban tobacco is just different.  Different plants, different soil, different climate, etc.  

It‚Äôs like asking why certain wines are different-different grapes from different places in a different climate."
"Age comes into play when you're dealing with Cubans. They are generally shipped fresher so that may play into how you perceive the smell.

I've had it go both ways - CCs that smell divine and NCs that smell like barnyard/hay and vice versa. It's not a consistent measure in my experience and usually doesn't tell me much about how it will taste. A pre-light cold draw is a better indicator but even that is far from the full picture of what a cigar has to offer."
"Cuban cigars have a unique flavor. Not necessarily better but completely Cuban. I think some Dominican cigars have a similar feel to them. Premium Cuban cigars all use  tobacco from a very isolated area of Cuba and only that tobacco represents the highest standard of Cuba. From elsewhere in Cuba, most Cuban fakes come from, and don't have the same complexity but still taste like Cuba. New world cigars are some of the best in the world because of their high quality control and manufacturing standards but  if you want the flavor of a Cuban cigar you have to smoke a Cuban cigar."
"Don't smoke it right away. 

Improper storage conditions must have caused a secondary fermentation. 

Here's a [link to an article ](https://www.cheaphumidors.com/blogs/general-information/why-cigars-smell-like-ammonia-and-how-to-fix-them)"
Maybe it's Cat Piss....Maybe It's Rocky Patel........
"Typically an ammonia smell means very young tobacco, more rare in non Cuban cigars.

Usually yellowing of the cellophane means some age, like years of age.

So... not sure what's going on here ü§∑"
The fermentation process is supposed to eradicate that ammonia. Perhaps this one didn‚Äôt get sufficient time fermenting. Needs to rest a good long time I think.
Maybe there‚Äôs weed in it?
"When I first smelled a cigar, I thought it smelled like urine also."
That smell and a yellowing of the cellophane are both good signs. Enjoy!
