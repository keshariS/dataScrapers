I won a ridiculous amount of stogies from an unnamed auction site that included many low to mid range sticks I have never tried before. Cheers to the community for sucking me into that vortex of an auction site and expanding this hobby for me.

Enter the Ave Maria Dark Knight. For me, paired with a Dr. Pepper Cream Soda, its like the average looking girl you gave a chance to and ended up falling head over heels for. I really enjoy this cigar, the construction and burn have always been flawless for me and the flavors I really enjoy. 

My question is for someone who has tried this stick before, are there any similarly flavored sticks in the more premium range or price points that would be worth me giving a shot? If not even premium, anything else similar? Its becoming a regular in my line up and the price point is unbeatable for how well i enjoy it.

Side note is i really do not see Ave Maria cigars being talked about much on the sub. Ive had great luck with the Dark Knight and Immaculata - that one is a pure graham cracker stick.

Basically, I feel taken advantage of on this ""deal"". I'm not sure what to do as I cannot get a response from CK after multiple attempts to contact them.

As a customer, a response would be nice. At this point, my expectations are low and I really just want to be able to return these cigars/get my money back. I'd even be ok just to return the Davidoffs even though the Padrons aren't spectacular, it was fair for $100.

I can't recommend CigarKing at this point. I would be 100% satisfied just to return the cigars but that is not an option on their website and customer service has been non-existent.

I've never experienced this before and hope to never deal with this type of service again."

I just received a couple of Oliva Serie V Melanio No. 4s and was wondering if it's safe to put them into cellophane before putting them in my humidor. Every other stick in my humidor is wrapped in cellophane, so it feels odd to have these 2 sticks without. I know that the whole with or without cellophane is a personal preference, so I guess my preference is to keep them on. Anyway, I have a couple of empty cellophane wrappers from cigars that I smoke a few months ago (don't ask why I kept them) and carefully slotted the Olivas into them. The cellophane seemed clean to the naked eye. Wondering if it's ok to put those sticks into cellophane that was used to store different cigars?"

Would appreciate if someone gives their advice that lives in a cold,dry, climate. 
I currently live in Colorado Springs. 

My tupperdors have been kept at 65% humidity with boveda. 

I  had a wrapper that split so I switched to 69%. Thought it would be a good idea since it‚Äôs gotten cold and my tupperdors sit at 60 degrees. 

My cigars are smoking bitter now towards the 2/3 and have a slight metallic taste. Speed isn‚Äôt an issue, I just smoked a robusto that took me an hour and I didn‚Äôt have the pencil tip end. Purging helped but the bitterness would eventually creep in. 

The wrapper splitting could have been due to the cold and it was a thin Cameroon wrapper, nice cigar though, a Casa Fuente. I also didn‚Äôt let it acclimate to the cold temperature. 

TLDR 

Any one live in a cold, high elevation climate? 
What humidity do you keep your cigars when they are stored at 60 degrees?"

2022-12-01 10:09:29,cigars,What's the most recent cigar that knocks your socks off? Really impressed you.,"Recents for me including two that are probably the best I've ever smoked.

1. (tie)Liga Privada T52 Corona Doble(most recent, yesterday)
2. (tie)Placensia Alma Fuerte Robustus I, Nester IV, Eduardo I, and Sixto I
3. Oliva Serie V Melanio Maduro Double Toro

For me it is Liga Privada T52 Corona Doble. My first experience with an Drew Estate cigar. I got them in this week and wanted to smoke one to see if I wanted to order more. The answer is a resounding yes. This is possibly the best cigar I've ever had. So much so I felt like Data(Star Trek: Picard) and kept thinking ""I don't want the game to end."" When I'd smoked it down to the tiniest mustache burning nub I could, I set it in my ashtray and said ""You deserve a dignified death.""

And then I smoked a second last night. Had to. And I felt every bit the same about it. I decided to try a retrohale on this for the first time. Sort of funked up my sinuses and made my eyes water, so maybe I need to work on my technique or possibly it's not for me. But, this is the first time I've been able to describe a cigar outside of sweet, spicy, or leather. I got a nice, strong cedar note from the retrohale. I could smoke those all day if my wallet would let me. Now to let the rest of them rest in the box for a while. I have No. 9s too so really looking forward to that later in the month.

But I've had three recently. In third place is the Oliva Serie V Melanio Maduro Double Toro. Had it for the first time maybe four weeks back. Awesome, awesome. But it's third not because of anything wrong with it. It's just not the level of the LP and...

My other tied for first is Plasencia Alma Fuerte. Robustus I, Nestor IV, Sixto I, and Eduardo I. I've had all and can't say I have a favorite. I almost didn't try them. I had a freebie Robustus I from an online order in the spring. I was about to donate it to a charity because I don't normally smoke cigars that size. But,  I had watched videos on it and seen really good stuff. So I gave it a try. And when I smoked it I said ""That's one of the best cigars I've ever had"" just like with the LP. I went out that weekend and picked a Nester IV, Eduardo I, and Sixto I. All awesome.

I definitely loaded up on Plasencia this past week and change. Thank you Perfect Cigar Blend. And I felt I had to order a second box of LPs after trying them. Super looking forward the LP No. 9. Maybe your local shop has some Plasencias and T52s you can pick a single up of(tough to find the LP I think) or maybe you can order a sampler. I'd say if these are anywhere in your flavor profile and budget(because they aren't cheap) then you should find an opportunity to try them. If you're looking for a special occasion cigar I can't recommend these enough.

Next up, Dunbarton. I really hope I get a similar experience from some of their line up. Steve Saka and all maybe I will."

When I first acquired it last summer, I didn't know any better and only used one 84% Boveda pack to season it for a 2-week period. I don't remember what the RH was at the end of the 2 weeks. Anyway, the humidor is now filled about 3/4 with two 60g 72% Bovedas, and my calibrated hygrometers have both been consistently reading between 63% and 65% RH for about a month. Temp is at 68¬∞F. Honestly, I'm fine with keeping my sticks at a low RH, but given the fact that I'm using 72% Bovedas, shouldn't the RH be a little higher? The seal on the humidor doesn't seem terrible, so I'm surprised that I'm losing 7%-9%. Is losing this much humidity common with wooden humidors?  Not sure if I need to re-season it (properly this time), or leave it as is (since I'm ok with mid-/low-60s) and assume all is well. Any help or advice would be greatly appreciated!"

A little backstory: back in 2014, I was in Costa Rica for a friends wedding. While there, I popped into a cigar shop and picked up two Cohiba Behike cigars. Back then, these were $60 each. Because they were such a spendy treat, I always knew I was going to save them for a special occasion, though didn‚Äôt quite know what it would be at the time. Fast forward, and I‚Äôve met the love of my life, and along the way got her father back into smoking cigars. You see, he had dropped the habit for quite sometime (he used to smoke a stick or two a day a long time ago), but I always talked about how I enjoyed cigars with my father and would playfully mention how I wish we could enjoy one one day. It‚Äôs a really fond memory of mine when out of the blue he surprised me (and his family) by grabbing two of his former everyday favorites and inviting me to enjoy a scotch and cigar with him one night. It was a huge bonding moment; it had been years since he enjoyed a cigar before then. You should‚Äôve seen the look my fianc√©‚Äôs mother gave him and me‚Äîit was very special. Since then, we‚Äôve had many great conversations over a cigar.

My conundrum here is that I only have the two Behike cigars. My father and I bonded over cigars, too, and it‚Äôs him who I learned to love and understand cigars. Ideally, I‚Äôd like to find another Behike so that we three‚Äîmy Dad, my Father-in-Law, and me‚Äîcould enjoy these special sticks together on my upcoming wedding day. 

Where I need your collective help is where to find another Behike. I‚Äôve looked online but I worry about the legitimacy of some sites, especially since these sticks have gone up so much in price and Cohibas are counterfeited often. Also I know Cubans need a bit of aging, and I‚Äôve been careful in aging these two. Back in the golden days of yore when we‚Äôd trade or bomb other members here, I‚Äôd ask if anyone had one in their collection that they had taken good care of and set up a trade. It‚Äôs a bummer that ended back in 2018. So for now, if anyone can point me in the right direction or to resources to finding a Behike, I‚Äôd appreciate it greatly. 

Cheers everyone!

Your humble Tobacconist here with a little tidbit on how to better treat your smoke shop Joe's. We love the tastes and textures and the all round experience that cigars provide. Upon posting this I enjoyed an Oliva series G Toro ( Very good lunch cigar btw).  In my musings I find myself recalling some of the less savory aspects of my work. Namely, if you visit my shop, and ask for or demand in some cases a discount you do not qualify for, and we give it to you as apart of both customer service and kindness, don't be an asshole and not tip at least a small part of the savings to your Tobacconist. 

I know that this reddit hates the idea of tipping, and to each their own. However,  we are all human, we have a shared hobby, and selfishness is not what cigar culture is about.  If we save you say $44 on a discount through our efforts, can you really not afford $4? Smoke on brethren."

My latest pickups are a box of Drax Redux 2, H. Upmann 175th Anniversary and Macanudo Vintage Maduro 1997. Love them all.

2022-11-27 13:36:20,cigars,Oliva Advent Calendar final thoughts,"So I used the advent calendar to count down to thanksgiving. (List of cigars at the bottom in alphabetical order)

Humidity:

The humidification held up very well. There are 2 integrated packs that come in the calendar and all of the sticks are perfectly humidified from the start to the finish. 

HOWEVER, the longer you wait to purchase yours the more likely the humidity packs will be dried out. Should be fine for a December countdown for Christmas but the longer you wait the bigger rush you‚Äôre taking. 

Lighter:

The lighter that came with it is surprisingly good. I was expecting a shitty plastic lighter that might be good for 1 or 2 sticks. This lighter is metal has good weight and i lit every cigar from the calendar with it with no issues. 

Final thoughts:
It was a delicious 25 days. If you are not an everyday smoker it may be a challenge. I smoke usually about 4-5 times a week so it wasn‚Äôt too bad. Also you obviously don‚Äôt need to smoke one everyday and can use it for 25 surprise sticks and smoke at your own place. Highly recommended for someone looking for new sticks to smoke regularly. The best stick in the whole box is by far the Oliva V Melanio toro round.

However, I am having one large issue regarding my cigar smoking experience, and Google is giving me so many mixed answers, so I thought I‚Äôd just come the place where the people know best.

While smoking a cigar, how far down do I allow it to burn before I leave it and bin it? Down to the sticker? Do I remove the sticker beforehand to be able to get as close down to my finger as possible? I‚Äôm really not quite sure where I stand in this current situation, as there is always about an inch left on each cigar once I reach the sticker, but I am just not sure how to go about passing by the sticker. I feel as though I am wasting quite a lot by leaving out that final inch or so.

1. 100 capacity tupperdoor, with 2 72 humidity bovitas and I can't get it over 65. Is 65 fine? (Home/ outdoor at 40 humidity) can I just add some water to the walls?

2. I have been buying a lot online, they always come hard as a brick, how long should they rest at 65? Do they rest faster if I take off cellophane?
Also English 2nd please excuse!
Thanks,

2022-11-26 14:19:17,cigars,Wrapper can't be grown in the Dominican,Any Opus fan knows the story..   I find something resembling irony in the fact that the the DR went from a unworthy of growing wrapper tobacco to suddenly having a wrapper tobacco that not only was useable but used in one of the most iconic and upper end cigars in the international industry.   What gives?  If Fuente was able to scratch out a usable wrapper leaf it would be one thing but to go from it can't be done to world class is noteworthy.   Really gotta hand it to Carlito.

I‚Äôm relatively new at this game only been smoking for over a year now (4-5 sticks per week) and Davidoff was my fav until today.. the draw, complexion and taste was just perfect for my taste. I think you may not like it if you are into dark/heavy sticks. obviously everyone is different, but i learnt my lesson. Never judge a cigar before trying it yourself, might be pleasantly surprised!"

I was hoping I could get some feedback on the proper RH to store cigars specific to my climate. 

I have 2 tupperdores and one humidor, I keep them in my home at 66F year-round. 

Most everyone here I see says to store at 65%. 
My local b&m says 65% in the summer, 72% in the winter. 

I‚Äôm in iowa. Currently the humidity is at 26%(normal for winter). In the summer it never drops below 90%. 

I smoked a small Cohiba Memories kept in my humidor alone at 72% for 2 weeks; was good. 
Currently running an experiment; I have 2 Cohiba Memories in their own containers, one at 65%, one at 72%. Plan to let them rest 2 weeks and see which I prefer.

Does the temp/humidity of the location you smoke at affect how you should store them, aside from possibly storage leaks(mine stay super consistent, no leakage!)? That‚Äôs the only reason I can come up with why my local b&m suggested that. But I don‚Äôt know them well at all, past a handful of transactions."

I ordered and received a Needone 16L cooling only humidor today.  Nice looking unit, but it has a problem.  I have it placed in a room with an ambient temp of 71.  I have the humidor set to 69.  The internal temp will not go above 63 degrees, I believe this is due to the fact that the fan will not turn off - it's always circulating air, and it's acting like a fridge.  The only way to solve the issue is to unplug it, at which point it will eventually match the ambient room temp - which defeats the purpose.  Other than this, it's a wonderful unit, the shelves look great, construction of the enclosure is very professional, it's really nice.  I think the only option is to return it and get the heating and cooling version.  Anyone else run into this problem with the cooling only unit?  Amazon reviews talk about it at length - which I didn't see until after I received it and did some research."

Over the past few years of smoking cigars, I‚Äôve gotten better at naming the flavors I‚Äôm tasting. For me, it‚Äôs been a useful way to identify what is unique in the cigars I like, whereas before a lot more cigars had just tasted fairly generic beyond strength and level of pepper.

But while leather is one of the most common flavors smokers taste in cigars, I can‚Äôt seem to work out what flavor tastes so leather-like to other people. Do people taste this more on the draw? The retrohale?

I thought I might try smoking two cigars with a strong leather taste and two that lack leather as a contrast. And if I still can‚Äôt taste it, I‚Äôll at least have tried a few new cigars. Any suggestions would be helpful."

My usual preferred size/gage is a corona for full size so already I'm not a big fan of the massive sticks as a general rule. Plus I'd rather smoke a higher quality small stick than a lower quality full size stick when it comes to budgeting for the daily smokes. It's all for the love of cigars, right?

I usually smoke Arturo Fuente Cubanito's or Exquisito's but I've just had no luck finding them lately. I took the plunge on a tin of Undercrown Maduro's and smoked one this morning over coffee. What a great little stick! I think this might become my daily driver with the free fall pricing on CigarBid. I'm going to try out the Liga Privada line too. 

Thanks to you guys I came back around to Drew Estate and what a delightful surprise their not infused smokes are. I can't wait to try more. 


Sorry for the lack of pictures in my recent posts. I don't take many, not the greatest photog and we've all seen these sticks before. I just appreciate an avenue to talk cigars with folks that I don't get in real life. Maybe I need to make time to visit the cigar lounge more for cocktails and a stogie.

It was like a clove cigarette without the harshness. In fact it didn't have any harshness. It reminded me of a Tatiana. It was sweet, aromatic, and clovey. 
About half way through I got some traditional cigar notes. I'm a pipe smoker and it reminded me of what I thought smoking a pipe would taste like before I smoked a pipe. During the last third I realized this was a real cigar. The construction remained perfect all the way through. The flavor was more nuanced with notes of leather, cloying sweetness, and cedar.
After I was done I checked the band. It was a Deadwood Leather Rose. That's exactly what it tasted like. I'm sure that was helpful."

Think most old Clint Eastwood characters, Graves from League of Legends, Fidel Castro etc. 

Thing is, I've never smoked in my life and don't really know how to incorporate this character trait into our role playing and story. 

I don't want it to be his defining trait, but definitely something to add some flavor and fun here and there.

I imagine him as someone who has a taste for finer things, but is chronically bad with money and has to settle for cheaper stuff often. Given it's a fantasy setting, I expect some kind of tobacco analogue to be available, but there may be other similar alternatives. I imagine him smoking cigars for almost 200 years, and expect to play him as fairly addicted and with it affecting his health somewhat 

Is there anything I should definitely know? Ideas for how to bring this part of his character to life in a fun way? Things a nonsmoker might mistakenly say/do I should avoid?

I was at a wedding, already preety drunk from a combination of cheap blended whiskey and average wine. Dinner was preety good and I am a very good eater and got my belly full of very fine Portuguese food. Once the dinner was over and the cake cerimony was concluded everyone went to the dancing floor where more cheap whiskey and some very cheap unmarked cigars were available for the guests to smoke. I love smoking while drinking and partying so I picked one up, lighted it in a very crude and savage way and began smoking it like it was cigarette inhaling as much smoke as I could. As I‚Äôm dancing I started feeling quite nauseous and thought that it was a good idea to slow down on the spirits and kept smoking the cigar furiously. Suddenly my nausea had grown to insurmountable levels and as I took a last tragic puff of the cigar I felt a dazzling back pain and a urge to vomit every single thing I had drank and eaten that night. Luckily I have some practice holding my stomach contents in and managed to start sprinting outside of the party tent and furiously expelled vomit until I was empty plus some 5 minutes of gagging. Luckily there was only a few friends and close family arround and I avoided being branded as the drunken fool of the party. 

So yeah, for new smokers, don‚Äôt inhale cheap wedding cigar smoke while very drunk. Thanks!"

I‚Äôm thinking the issue is we have gas heat and our house RH is around 40, so the packs can‚Äôt keep up.  Any ideas would be appreciated. 

#2 - I have a full box arriving this week and plan to store them in their box, inside an Xikar large travel case. Boveda packs in place and my Govee shows a steady 68RH. Any issues with this plan?

Thanks for the help. Just don‚Äôt want to loose any sticks ‚Ä¶ Cheers"

I bought them right after smoking one from I got from a cigar store that is about an hour away. Was in the area and just dropped by. So today I'm smoking one that I got from Jr and it taste really bland and not like the one I got from the store. It's been held in my humidor steady at 68/68. I called the store just to confirm what humidity they store at they said 67/68. So  I'm at a loss. And to be honest this isn't the first time  this has happened for me. I find that if I buy cigars (online especially) and store them in my humidor for a couple weeks or more they taste bland.
 I even got a new humidor as the other was glass top thinking that maybe somehow that had something to do with it. This one is solid and holds temp/humidity steady. Also I have a digital gauge next to cigars inside humidor for readings"

2022-11-21 19:54:59,cigars,Review | A. Fuente - Unnamed Reserve 2021,"Ok. So. There‚Äôs so much going on with these, that I had to delay writing this review just so I could smoke one more. 

**Presentation** 

After all the pomp-and-circumstance that comes with any Arturo Fuente (and you remove the cedar sleeve and footband), you find a gorgeous natural wrapper that has scents of hay and yeast; with the most subtle sweetness underneath. The foot is beautiful, with a notable swirl throughout. 

I opted for a classic straight cut on each. 

**Cold Draw** 

A sweet/salty pretzel. Period. Some hinting at a honey-like flavor, but nothing too potent. 

**First Third** 

Wow. Punch of flavor right out the gate. A lot of earthy, breadiness; shockingly complimented by a floral sweetness. Every puff develops more of each of those flavors in contrast. Initial retrohale‚Äôs tended to have a bit more peppery-sharpness that eased up and mellowed out as time went on. As that pepper fades, a velvet-y chocolate takes command. 

**Second Third** 

Excellent combustion. A white ash just highlights the quality aging on this tobacco. A bit more attention is required here, both on developing flavors (like wood and nut); and also on the stick itself. I found myself puffing more frequently, without really feeling an increase in smoke temperature. 

**Final Third** 

And still, more flavor depth and development. The alkalinity of this stick keeps that salivation flowing. Right around the top of where the band was is where things started to take an interesting twist. The medium bodied part is done, and a full flavored nicotine kick shows up to say hi. Doesn‚Äôt stick around too long, then you‚Äôre closing this smokey treat with that chocolate covered pretzel you were teased with on the cold draw. 

**Overall** 

This is just one of those cigars that challenges the palette, and forces you to think outside the box. A perfect draw all the way through, and excellent smoke production; this does not disappoint. 

As this is a limited release cigar, I won‚Äôt talk about price as a factor. Just remember that your kids won‚Äôt actually need to go to college. 

**Rating** 

I‚Äôm giving this a 93. All things considered, this is one for the books!"

&#x200B;

Don't slap me. I haven't had one before. There was a shop that had some Liga Privada No9 but they were part of a sampler pack with some stuff I knew I didn't want to smoke. Other wise I'd be trying one.

But they seem like a fan favorite. As are Padron anniversary which I know are just about not discounted because they sell themselves. But I have had Padrons and know they are worth it. On the other hand there doesn't appear to be a shortage of the Padrons. They seem to keep up with demand, well sort of. I don't really know the story of Liga Privada and why they are hard to come by. I'd love to hear more about them if someone can speak on it or link a good source.

BTW. Having my first Montecristo 1935 Anniversary Nicaragua Toro. I can't speak much to the notes. But it's a good smoke. Well constructed. Good draw. Hasn't needed touching up through the first half including having to let my dog out for a few minutes. I came back and the cigar was right and ready to keep smoking. I get no sweetness. Maybe I'm getting the leather. If you want a full tasting cigar and don't like the little sweet of some of the Maduros, this is probably a good choice.

I'm used to a robusto lasting 45 minutes or so at my normal pace. Hooooly shit I underestimated this thing. That pic is at a **steady** puff rate over a half hour already, more toward 40 minutes. Am I complaining though? Absolutely NOT. This thing might be overtaking the 15th Anniversary and the Royale for my all time favorite NC stick. I have been bringing them all to 65% RH, and the rest were all smoked near 70%, so I'll have to do another test with them to see if the RH drop plays that much into it."

Does the EUs and Swedens taxes apply to the shipping costs? Or would it be cheaper, than ordering from an online store in Sweden?

I was thinking of ordering boxes from there. If the answer is yes for all the questions, would the cigars get damaged during shipping?

2022-11-21 10:59:15,cigars,Finding your go-to's/Thankful for the community,"I've been smoking a lot of everything popular for over a year since I gave up smoking cigarettes. What a fantastic decision that was BTW.
I started with Oliva Serie V, V Melanio and Maduro, MB3. Really hit my palette right early on. I'm just finding it interesting how we settle into preferences with smokes and accessories. I recently set up my office with HEPA filtration and smoke sealed the door.

For example on preference, I don't use anything but a XV2 or Colibri V-cut now. I'm not sure why, I have 5 quality cutters around from a 8, 10, 11mm punch to an XO etc. but it's just a deep V-cut is the draw and mouth feel I prefer now for some reason. Maybe except for a hard box press I may occasionally use a punch.

I enjoyed a lot of Drew Estate/Liga stuff for a while. Thought it was very good. #9, T52, L, various Unicos etc... I still enjoy the H99 very much actually, might be the best they've produced based on today's quality. I'm sure 13 year old #9's were unbelievable....Herrera can blend though IMO. His original Habano is a very decent smoke for that matter, I just tried it on Friday for the first time. Bought a box of Robusto Grande afterwards.

I've tried many lines of everything from Padron, to La Palina, to Tatuaje, Fuente, Carrillo,   Oliva, Foundation to Aladino, El Titan, and everything in between. I probably have close to 1,500 cigars now.  Slowly, I became more focused on San Andres and then Connecticut Broadleaf w mostly Nica filler without really realizing it.
If every Vitola could be a true, soft box-pressed 48-50 x 6"" I'd be in heaven. Mix in a round 52 on occasion.

Recently, I've found myself smoking almost exclusively Dunbarton by the box. The original blue band Mi Querida is just such an excellent smoke, I can't stop picking them up. Straightforward, earthy, dense almost juicy if you will typical Connecticut Broadleaf, but interesting enough to always keep my attention. I don't pick out too many tasting notes but my palette knows what it likes and it's not tasting any better. I mix it up with a Tricqui Traca (love the added sprinkling of Ligero after dinner) and a delicious, almost creamy/slightly spicy Sobremesa occasionally as well when I want a bit lighter Ecuadorian wrapper and Nica filler. It's as if Saka took the #9 dark and oily, CB wrapper, mixed blend formula and perfected it for Mi Querida for less than 2/3's the price. What a sleeper of a cigar in Fino Ancho or Largo, and can be found for under $8 a cigar on the right occasions by the box. I know I'm 6 years late to the party but wow! Feels good to have an everyday smoke that is reliable and has impeccable construction and consistency. Maybe not Padron consistency, but nobody else has that. They are an unbelievable and wonderful anomaly.

Just rambling and thinking about how our tastes change and how we change. Thanks for listening! Any suggestions or comments please throw them up, I'd love to hear it. Save your important questions for Fish or krispy üòÖ. 

I hope you all have a great Thanksgiving and I'm thankful for the knowledge shared here that led me to my favorite and most relaxing hobby."

About 10 days ago I had the misfortune of suffering from the mother of all food poisoning, I won‚Äôt go into details but my diet has been steamed rice and bananas for basically  every meal ever since. But among the many side effects i have developed a sudden repulsion towards cigars and it just f****ng sucks coz I‚Äôve just finished restocking my humidor. For the first week after the stomach issues even the thought of a cigar made me gag and tonight for the first time I‚Äôve forced myself into a Davidoff Churchill Bellicoso and not only am I not enjoying it, I‚Äôm getting cold sweats on the back of my head. Is this permanent? Did it ever happen to any of you? How long until you recovered? I was loving this so so much and im not afraid to say that im actually scared that it‚Äôs over.

Some difficulties in my personal life have led me to the realization that I am NEVER relaxed, and I‚Äôd like to change that. Cigars smell lovely and the ritual of smoking them looks soothing. 

That being said, I‚Äôd like to mitigate health risks. I know that there‚Äôs no nonzero amount of smoking that is completely free of risk, but would a habit of, say, one or two cigars a week pose health risks that most would consider substantial? I‚Äôm a 26 year old male with no preexisting physical health issues, and oral cancers don‚Äôt run in my family. I feel like smoking this infrequently is probably low-risk as far as vices go, but I wanted to be sure.

Beyond that, what‚Äôs good equipment to start with? Any particular kind of lighter necessary? And should I get a dedicated cutting tool, or would a pocket knife do? 

As far as the cigars themselves go, I obviously don‚Äôt need to be springing for the most expensive ones I can find, but I‚Äôm also not touching cheap gas station stuff either. What‚Äôs a rough price range that tends to indicate at least decent quality? Any particular brands to recommend?

2022-11-19 22:05:36,cigars,Montecristo Epic 12. Epic indeed!,"I‚Äôll tell you what.  This cigar is a whole mood. It says medium though I‚Äôd give it a 6-7 in strength and 8-9 in flavor strength. The wrapper is thick and oily. It has the appearance of well conditioned leather. From the aroma and flavor down to the well designed classy band, this cigar evokes feelings of deep rich worn-in soft brown leather and deep dark solid wood. I feel I did it a great disservice by smoking it in a brightly lit cold garage. I paired it with Penelope cask strength bourbon, and it did well. Though, I feel it would have been better with an older Irish whisky or scotch. Maybe 15 years or more. It started with strong leather, cedar, and pepper. A light bit of caramel. The Carmel leaves quickly and the pepper is gone in the first third. The cedar and leather remain richly through the cigar. The smoke was soft and thick. It was nice in that you could feel it as it filled your mouth and as it flowed out slowly. The cigar was very high maintenance, requiring absolute attention to pace and burn. It required multiple touch-ups and one relight. Although it was high maintenance, it is well deserved. This cigar is something you smoke when you want to focus on cigars. It‚Äôs not something to do ‚Äúwhile‚Äù you do something else. It‚Äôs simple something you do when you want to concentrate on a cigar. I‚Äôm glad I have a box and will bring these out when it‚Äôs time to end a night and cap off a celebration."

I'll keep the ones that score high for me in a separate environment to age and see how they fare after. I see a lot of people say things like they're aging and then they're getting the stick back out in 4 or 6 months but it seems to me you're not aging until you're at a year or more.

2022-11-19 17:20:02,cigars,A question about fake Cubans,"I have a friend that has recently had some cause for celebration and he wants to offer me a Cohiba to smoke with him.

He has a box of these Cohibas. I took a look and I believe they are fakes.

He told me he payed substantially less for the price of the box when he was in Cuba. He payed a lad that worked in his hotel to boost the box from the hotel gift shop.

I believe the more likely story is that this guy sold him a counterfeit box.

I inspected the sticks and the top row of white squares on the band were not full. They were cut off at the top.

So my question is, what are counterfeiters actually selling? Are they just inferior quality cigars, of are they sticks of dubious quality potentially hazardous to smoke?

In the interest of being a good guest and accepting generous hospitality, I would prefer to just smoke a fake. I also don't really want to be the guy to tell him he bought fakes. However, if they're something hazardous, that's a different story."

I wanna keep it reasonably priced (under or around $50 would be ideal, cheaper is always better if quality isn't sacrificed) and can't really find any good resources online. Searched on this sub and only found larger versions of what I'm looking for.

The problem I'm running into is I don't know a damn thing about any of this and don't want to end up buying something of questionable quality. I also don't want plain, boring plastic with nothing going on. It doesn't need to be the highest end thing or full of gimmicks but something tasteful that functions adequately is where I want to end up.

I was looking at these two ([1](https://www.amazon.com/Csonka-Accesorized-Pocket-Humidor-Burgandy/dp/B0001I0790) or [2](https://www.prometheuskkp.com/humidors/pocket-travel)) but the first one has very mixed reviews (one loves it, one hates it, no idea why) and the second is unavailable. Love that style though.

So, at worst, if you have any online stores that are known for hosting reputable brands that would be good enough. Or some things to look out for. Maybe there's a thing they put on humidors that sounds useful but is just a common gimmick or whatever idk. General guidance will be appreciated in leu of direct recommendations."

2022-11-18 09:39:11,cigars,Humidor seasoning question,"Is seasoning really necessary? 

I received a Brookstone humidor for Christmas about 6 years ago and transferred my collection from a tupperware right to it. I use Boveda 69% packs as I was told it was a fool proof way of keeping them fresh. Over the years I‚Äôve gotten a little more into cigars and recently started finding some YouTube material to watch and try and learn a bit more. I noticed a video the other day from Cigar Daily showing how to season a new humidor by wiping it down with a sponge and so on. I never did this from the beginning. I‚Äôve only used the 69% packs and the hygrometer stays steady in the 68-70% range all the time. Cigars seem to be nice, but I‚Äôm still fairly new to it. 

Am I missing out on anything or could my cigars be that much better if I took the steps to season my humidor? Or is it fine from over the years keeping the packs in that I have?"

I almost smoke exclusively Cubans, I enjoy R&J Churchills, Upmann 50, D4, Monte #1, CORO etc. 

I have never really enjoyed non-Cuban cigars but I think that is because I am trying the wrong ones. I enjoy smooth, creamy smokes, very little pepper or sharp spices, but full of flavor. 

I am thinking of going Davidoff, Padron 1926 and 1964 natural, Fuente Hemingway, Don Carlos GOF, and Opus X.

Without any rush I'm searching for my first cigar humidor. As I already searched information about them, cookies were working properly and google knows what I need to see. So this product popped up for me [link](https://twitter.com/DealsWizzard/status/1593237717285937153?s=20&t=HX8k7VKCLQnvhizruJ5Mvw) and now I'm really confused...   
I was searching for humidors at my local stores and on nearest to my location ali-express alternative and I never saw prices like this. The cheapest ones I can find for 5 cigars are already around 30-40$ but bigger ones are over 100-150$, even on my ali-express alternative site.   
So I'm wondering if this humidor is actuallyt good and won't be a waste of money? Isn't it just a single use cigar box that's just called a humidor? O.k. it's on discount but still I can't find at 80$ humidors for 20-30 stogies. At that price I can find only small ones where longer stogies even won't fit in.   
So maybe someone can help with advice is this o.k. and how much a good quality humidor should cost?   
Thank you!"

My cigar pick ups for a pipe smoker starting out in cigars. 

-Olivia Connecticut Reserva 
- Rocky Patel Connecticut Vintage 1999
- Romeo Y Julieta 1875 Connecticut 
- Montecristo White Series 
- Padron Damaso 

Has anyone had these before? What's your thoughts on them? 
Do you have any personal recommendations for someone new?
I have only had 5-10 mild cigar once in a blue moon on special occasions over a course of 25 years. So, yeah a complete novice. 

I do tend to smoke my pipe drinking and hanging with the boys usually a aromatic or a oriental those are my top pipe favorite after this it would be a English blend. 
My bottom least favorite is perique and my least favorite is straight Virginia's but now I am speaking on pipe tobacco.
But, if there is any pipe and cigar smokers out there maybe that will give more clue on my taste. 
When I can't really say on what my profile is with cigars other then I lean towards creamy then spicy. Not saying spicy can't be okay for a change. 

How was my cigar picks? Not feeling too confident since I am new. A buddy of mine told me to try the 1875 I grabbed because he thought it would be a nice beginner cigar. 
That's the only one I am guessing should be a good pick.

Draw was horriblly tight...had to use perfect draw over and over for the duration. They've been kept around 66% RH so I can't see that being the issue. Flavor was so-so, and started getting super hot about halfway through, had to lower it to about a puff a minute and even then it was still pretty hot. This included blowing out regularly...

Construction was outstanding, that was probably the best feature to be honest. That ash was rock solid and it burnt for almost an hour, which was way more than I expected from a robusto.

Maybe I just need to try one of the maduros though? Maybe just a bad stick?"

My question is about humidors. Is there any humidors I can put on my dresser that will hold at least 50 cigars. 
That will properly house the cigars safely over a long time. 
I hear so much controversy about use this or that. As someone new I don't want to buy something and end up with bugs, or mold or problems. 
So, I maybe new but perfer to start right. So, if I can get personal help I'd appreciate. 

As for cigars I was think I'd start with stuff like Ashton classic, Arturo Fuente 858, Rocky Patel Connecticut Vintage 1999, Aganorsa Leaf Connecticut, EPC New Wave Connecticut,  Brickhouse Double Connecticut, Olivia Connecticut Reserve.
Just as ideas of what I was thinking. If any of these are redundant please let me know as well.

Anyway, these have always been consistent if anything. And always improved with aging, but these have a smell and taste that I don't think can improve.

That said, sales guy said either send them back or I'll add a 35 dollar credit to your account. I took the credit.

But man was I ever disappointed with these. Just absolutely horrible, with an ever subtle chemical presence. We'll see if they get better. Been a couple weeks, and I had to boost up the humidity in my humidor even more than I normally do, because they were so darn dry, the first couple crumbled apart as I made the slightest cut....even more carefully than normal.
